If Gov. Gavin Newsom signs the bill, California would impose an 11% excise tax on all guns and ammunition sales. The proceeds would be spent on gun violence prevention and school safety programs. 

The federal government has long imposed an excise tax of 10% on the wholesale price of handguns and 11% on long guns and ammunition, with the proceeds funding conservation and hunter education. Some local jurisdictions including Seattle also have gun taxes.

The California bill received final passage in both the state Senate and Assembly Thursday. All Republicans in both chambers opposed it or didn¡¯t vote in preliminary tallies.

It now heads to the desk of Newsom, who hasn¡¯t taken a public position on the bill. Newsom has championed gun control and a new amendment to the U.S. constitution limiting Second Amendment right. A spokesman for the Democrat declined to comment.

Under the bill, sales made to law enforcement agencies and officers, or retired officers, would be exempt. In addition, firearms vendors with less than $5,000 in sales per quarter wouldn¡¯t have to impose the tax.

¡°It¡¯s shameful that gun manufacturers are reaping record profits at the same time that gun violence has become the leading cause of death for kids in the United States,¡± Jesse Gabriel, a Democratic Assembly member who authored the bill, said before the vote.

Gun-rights groups were lobbying until the last moment to quash the bill, which they say will make it harder for people to legally buy guns and price hunters and youth sports shooters out of their hobbies. 

¡°You can¡¯t tax a constitutional right,¡± said Chuck Michel, president of the California Rifle & Pistol Association, a firearms advocacy group. ¡°This is part of the strategy to price people out of the market.¡±  

Gun-control groups have pushed similar legislation around the country for years, with little prior success.

¡°The allocation of these funds will lay the necessary groundwork to prevent future devastation and unnecessary death,¡± said Kris Brown, president of Brady, a gun-control advocacy group.

Because it is a tax increase, the bill required approval from two-thirds of legislators in each chamber. Democrats currently hold supermajorities in the state Assembly and Senate.

California already imposes a fee of $37.19 on the sale of each firearm, the proceeds of which go toward law enforcement.

Hunter Biden¡¯s defense against federal firearm charges could get a boost from a recent Supreme Court decision bolstering Second Amendment rights, a ruling that came under heavy criticism from his father.

President Biden¡¯s son, in a three-count indictment Thursday, was accused of lying on a federal form when he bought a revolver several years ago by falsely claiming that he wasn¡¯t a drug abuser. Special counsel David Weiss also charged Hunter Biden with violating a federal law prohibiting unlawful drug users and addicts from possessing firearms.

The drug-user gun ban is among a litany of gun statutes that have faced new legal challenges as a result of last year¡¯s Supreme Court decision in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen.

In a 6-3 ruling, the court¡¯s conservative majority decreed that gun-control laws must be deeply rooted in historical precedent to pass constitutional muster. Governments defending them bear the burden of showing that their laws are similar, or at least analogous, to firearm regulations widely enforced around the time of the nation¡¯s infancy, the court said. 

Since the Bruen decision, several courts, including in an appeals court ruling last month, have ruled for defendants charged, like Biden, with violating the drug-user gun ban. And recently, some gun-rights advocates have been more vocal in pushing to invalidate that prohibition.

¡°There are constitutional questions swimming around the gun charge,¡± said Douglas Berman, a criminal-law professor at The Ohio State University. 

Early-American laws made it a crime to carry a gun while intoxicated. But judges ruling against the drug-user gun ban cited the absence of historical laws that entirely stripped away the gun rights of Americans who consumed intoxicating substances. 

Hunter Biden¡¯s lawyer, Abbe Lowell, has signaled a potential Second Amendment defense, referring to recent rulings in a statement Thursday.

President Biden, who supports tougher gun regulations, has said the Bruen decision ¡°should deeply trouble us all.¡± Since the ruling, his Justice Department has argued in numerous cases that drug users aren¡¯t protected by the Second Amendment.

In the recent appeals court case, the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, one of the nation¡¯s more conservative courts, threw out the conviction of a Mississippi man found with a rifle, a handgun and marijuana blunts in his pickup truck.

¡°Throughout American history, laws have regulated the combination of guns and intoxicating substances,¡± Judge Jerry E. Smith wrote for the court. ¡°But at no point in the 18th or 19th century did the government disarm individuals who used drugs or alcohol at one time from possessing guns at another.¡±

At least two federal district judges?one in Texas and the other in Oklahoma?found the same gun-ban statute in violation of the Second Amendment.

These rulings don¡¯t assure that Hunter Biden can prevail in court, as other judges have upheld the ban. A judge in South Dakota recently found it similar enough to old restrictions on firearm use while intoxicated. Habitual drug users and intoxicated people lack self-control, the judge said, making it dangerous for either to possess deadly firearms.

Defendants who prevailed in other cases were charged with possessing guns while being unlawful users of marijuana.

Biden, though, has acknowledged he wasn¡¯t just a drug user but an addict, one hooked to the harder drug of crack cocaine. That could make it easier for the government to compare the charges against him to longstanding gun restrictions on the mentally ill, according to gun-policy scholar Dave Kopel, research director at the Independence Institute, a free-market think tank.

¡°The Second Amendment defense is a plausible argument, yes,¡± said Kopel. ¡°But it¡¯s a lot harder one for Hunter Biden than most people prosecuted under the statute.¡±

The top charge?lying on a federal firearms form?is likely to be trickier to defend.

Prosecutors could point to a federal appeals court ruling in June that reinstated criminal charges against a man charged with lying on the same ATF form when he sought to buy a gun. That defendant had falsely claimed he wasn¡¯t under felony indictment when he sought to buy a gun. 

A district judge threw out the charge, on the grounds that people under indictment can¡¯t be banned from possessing guns. But the Seventh U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said that, regardless of the constitutionality of that ban, gun buyers can be required to fill out the ATF form truthfully.

¡°If something is unconstitutional and then you lie about it not applying to you, are you just as guilty for the lie?¡± said Berman. ¡°It¡¯s a legal puzzle.¡±",WSJ

High-profile Democratic governors are stumping for President Biden¡¯s 2024 re-election campaign and simultaneously auditioning to become the party¡¯s next standard-bearer.

Their efforts signal they are unlikely to cede that role in 2028 to Vice President Kamala Harris, whose sluggish approval ratings have raised doubts among some donors and party officials about whether she can effectively succeed Biden.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom has toured red states such as Idaho, Mississippi, Arkansas and Alabama to campaign for Biden and other Democrats, and earlier this year launched a political-action committee targeting Republican policies. He has found a foil in Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a contender for the 2024 Republican nomination. They have run attack ads against each other, sparred over issues such as climate change, abortion rights and gun control and agreed to a debate moderated by Sean Hannity on Fox News.

Maryland Gov. Wes Moore raised money for Democratic governors on the sidelines of the annual Allen & Co. Sun Valley Conference in July, offered a televised response to the first GOP debate and attended recent fundraisers in New York¡¯s summer enclaves of the Hamptons.

Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro will travel to New Hampshire next month for a keynote address to the state Democratic Party¡¯s convention. And Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, who was vetted as a possible Biden running mate in 2020, promoted the recent anniversary of the president¡¯s climate and jobs legislation.

The Democratic governors, including Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy and North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, have endorsed Biden¡¯s re-election and played down their presidential ambitions. But their work to build a national network, a common task by future presidential hopefuls, is more noteworthy this year as the president nears his 81st birthday and questions linger about whether he could serve a full second term that would take him to age 86.

Some Democrats privately say that should an unexpected health scare derail Biden¡¯s re-election campaign, many high-profile Democrats, including governors and members of Congress, would consider getting in the 2024 race alongside Harris. 

Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli?n Castro, who sought the Democratic nomination in 2020, said he expected any primary race to succeed Biden in 2028 would be ¡°contested¡± and called Harris a ¡°dynamic, compelling candidate in 2028.¡± But he added: ¡°Do I think everybody¡¯s just going to get out of the way? That¡¯s hard to imagine.¡±

Biden faces minimal opposition in the primaries from Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the nephew of President John F. Kennedy, who has promoted various conspiracies.

A Biden campaign aide said the president had promised to be a conduit to the next generation of Democratic leaders and has intentionally ensured his re-election campaign would help do that through surrogates.

The party is only three years removed from its last presidential cycle, when more than two dozen Democrats sought its nomination. Those include candidates who could mount future presidential campaigns, including Harris, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.

¡°In the absence of having a young, vibrant president, the party needs to put forward new faces, new voices,¡± said Nina Smith, a Democratic operative who worked for Buttigieg¡¯s presidential campaign. ¡°I think you¡¯re seeing the next generation of political leadership in this country emerging through the Biden re-election campaign and who the surrogates are.¡±

Harris¡¯s political abilities have been a prominent focus of Biden¡¯s first term and now his re-election campaign. Some Republican presidential candidates, such as former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, have said that re-electing Biden would lead to a Harris presidency. Polls of Democrats suggest voters would have preferred an alternative candidate at the top of the ticket. 

Harris has recently stepped up her public engagements, countering complaints from some Democrats that the vice president has faded from public view, and emerged as the administration¡¯s leading voice on issues such as abortion access and voting rights. Allies say Harris is singularly focused on the 2024 re-election campaign and not her political future, although some insist she will be a front-runner to lead the Democratic Party should she make another run for the White House.

Jamal Simmons, a former Harris communications director, said the vice president is an effective messenger against Republicans and suggested a contested primary would only make her stronger.

¡°I just think it would be incredibly hard to beat her with the institutional power she has, the democratic reach she has and her commitment to the issues that Democrats care about,¡± he said.

Buttigieg has focused on official travel as transportation secretary. His extensive travels promoting the infrastructure law and frequent cable television appearances have helped him maintain his role as one of the most recognizable Biden cabinet officials.

The former South Bend, Ind., mayor has effectively frozen his political committee since joining the cabinet but still wields clout from his 2020 campaign. After Biden announced his re-election bid, Buttigieg helped organize a New York City fundraiser in May at the home of former Blackstone executive Tony James.

Newsom has been arguably the most visible among the governors in elevating his profile. While he has maintained those efforts are simply in the service of his party, those stops have enabled the California governor to cultivate a database of potential supporters and meet with donors in states often overlooked by national Democrats. 

It is not uncommon for sitting or ex-vice presidents to face competition when seeking their party¡¯s presidential nomination and ultimately prevail. George H.W. Bush and Al Gore both went through contested primaries. Mike Pence has struggled to gain traction in a crowded 2024 Republican field dominated by former President Donald Trump. Biden himself faced a crowded Democratic field in 2020. 

Shapiro¡¯s trip to New Hampshire is expected to focus on the importance of Democrats winning the governor¡¯s race next year following the decision by Republican Gov. Chris Sununu to not seek another term. The speech will take place a week before a Democratic National Committee meeting in St. Louis where the fate of New Hampshire¡¯s first-in-the-nation primary could be decided.

¡°The most prominent figures on the Democratic bench are the ones out raising money for the Biden-Harris re-elect, and most of them are our Democratic governors,¡± said Alex Heckler, a Miami attorney who serves as deputy finance chair of the Democratic National Committee.

WASHINGTON?The Biden administration on Thursday proposed a rule that would subject more firearms purchasers to background checks without involving Congress?where Republican opposition has derailed tougher gun-safety measures.

The proposal would require anyone who earns a profit selling guns to get a federal license and mandate background checks. Under current rules, private dealers have been able to sell tens of thousands of firearms each year out of their homes, at gun shows and flea markets and through websites without running such checks. 

Private sellers are now required only to obtain licenses if they earn their livelihood dealing in firearms. Gun-control advocates have long argued that the qualification provides an opening for people whose backgrounds would bar them from gun ownership to easily buy weapons and use them in crimes.

President Biden has pushed for universal background checks, but Democrats have been unable to get that through Congress. The rule proposed Thursday builds on a gun bill Biden signed last year in response to a series of mass shootings that he said brought into focus the need to vastly expand background checks. 

An executive order Biden signed in March directed the Justice Department to expand the definition of being ¡°engaged in the business¡± of selling firearms and clarify which sellers, such as hobbyists or collectors, don¡¯t need to obtain a license. 

The president said the move was designed to bring the U.S. as close as possible to universal background checks without congressional action.

Gun safety is expected to be a major theme of Biden¡¯s re-election campaign, as the Democratic president hopes to tap into frustration with Republican inaction despite frequent mass shootings across the country. Aides says gun violence has become a more salient issue at the ballot box, particularly among suburban voters.

Since Biden signed 2022 firearms legislation, the widest in decades, he has struggled to advance priorities such as universal background checks. The president has also called for a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, as well as ending immunity from liability for gun manufacturers.

While addressing antigun violence advocates in Chicago, Vice President Kamala Harris?who is playing a prominent role in the 2024 campaign?took aim in mid-August at Republicans and opponents of stricter gun laws.

¡°There are some people who are just trying to sell a false choice,¡± Harris said, ¡°to suggest that you¡¯re either in favor of the Second Amendment or you want to take everyone¡¯s guns away.¡± 

Gun groups said they opposed the rule. Lawrence Keane, senior vice president and general counsel for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, a gun-industry trade group, said it appeared to exceed what was outlined in the bill that Congress passed. 

¡°It would also sweep in ordinary citizens to now require them to obtain a federal firearms license,¡± he said. ¡°That¡¯s not what the statute provided, or Congress intended.¡± 

Officials from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said Thursday that the proposed rule, which will be available for public comment for 90 days, was designed to provide clearer criteria for the public regarding which dealers must conduct background checks.

ATF Director Steven Dettelbach said the policy targets an increasing number of sellers who earn a profit selling guns but have chosen not to register and instead make money through off-book, illicit sales. 

¡°These activities undermine the law, endanger public safety, create significant burdens on law enforcement and are unfair to the many licensed dealers who make considerable efforts to follow the law,¡± Dettelbach said.",WSJ

Virginia voters¡¯ choices this November will give crucial clues about the direction of the national elections next November, and about the political future of a rising Republican star: Gov. Glenn Youngkin. 

Control of the state legislature is at stake, with all 140 seats in both chambers up for grabs. Democrats hold a slim majority in the Senate, Republicans have an edge in the House. 

Youngkin, while not on the ballot, is pushing hard for a GOP trifecta so he can pass a 15-week abortion limit and other conservative priorities?and so he can burnish his reputation as a Republican who can win in swing territory after his 2021 victory put him on the national map. 

If the Nov. 7 elections go well for his party, Youngkin could make a late entry into the 2024 presidential race?a prospect he hasn¡¯t ruled out and some national Republicans have pined for privately. GOP primary polling and some early ballot deadlines suggest such a bid would have little chance of success. 

Or Youngkin, 56 years old, could try to continue building legislative and political victories with an eye to running for president in 2028. Virginia governors can¡¯t serve consecutive four-year terms.

Dominance in the state¡¯s General Assembly likely will hinge on a handful of races. The nonpartisan Virginia Public Access Project rates four of 40 Senate races and seven of 100 House contests as competitive.

¡°Truly, this is anybody¡¯s game. I think it¡¯s going to be really tight,¡± said Rebecca Bromley-Trujillo, an associate professor of political science at Christopher Newport University.

With no marquee office on the ballot, the key for Republicans and Democrats will be motivating their bases, political analysts say, although both sides are vying for the sliver of potentially persuadable voters in the middle. 

Democrats are betting on abortion access to energize voters, along with gun-control measures and LGBT protections. Republicans are focusing largely on parental involvement in education as well as crime and the economy. 

¡°Because it¡¯s a turnout election, you can glean whose base is more mobilized to come out and vote,¡± said Democratic strategist Ben Tribbett. Democrats need a strong showing from the party¡¯s younger voters, he said, adding, ¡°If this is an election decided by senior citizens, Glenn Youngkin will take total control.¡±

Virginia¡¯s odd-year elections traditionally offer clues about the electorate¡¯s mood heading into national contests. The state used to lean Republican, but suburban growth, especially around Washington, has benefited the Democratic Party, which in 2019 won majorities in both houses for the first time since the 1990s. Republicans in 2021 captured the governorship and took back the House; Virginia is now one of just two states where each party controls one legislative chamber.

Youngkin, elected amid a wave of frustration over Covid-era school policies, has staked much on these elections. The former private-equity executive waded into 10 GOP primary fights, and all of his picks prevailed. Now his political operation is raising large sums as Youngkin rallies with candidates around the state. Taking a page from Democrats, he is encouraging Republicans to vote early and by mail.

¡°We¡¯re kind of engaged at every level of operations with these different campaigns,¡± said Dave Rexrode, chairman of Youngkin¡¯s Spirit of Virginia PAC. The PAC said it raised $3.3 million in August alone, and $12 million so far this year. Rexrode predicted Democrats would still outspend Republicans by up to $30 million, with the entire legislative campaign possibly costing $150 million.

Some of that cash is coming from Washington: The Democratic National Committee said Saturday it was putting an additional $1.2 million into Virginia¡¯s elections, bringing its total investment in the state so far this cycle to $1.5 million.

The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, charged with electing Democrats to statehouses, plans substantial financial and other support for Virginia candidates, a spokeswoman said. Its counterpart, the Republican State Leadership Committee, is coordinating efforts with Youngkin¡¯s PAC and other GOP arms, a spokesman said.  

¡°When Youngkin won, he was seen as almost the Republicans¡¯ shiny new object who was able to capture lightning in a bottle. So it¡¯s like, OK, are the Republicans going to get lucky again like that?¡± said J. Miles Coleman, associate editor of Sabato¡¯s Crystal Ball of the University of Virginia Center for Politics.

A recent Roanoke College poll found 51% of Virginians approve of Youngkin¡¯s job performance as governor, versus 40% job approval for President Biden, who won the state by 10 points in 2020. 

Yet the survey also pointed to why a late bid for the 2024 GOP nomination would be tough for Youngkin: Just 9% of Republican respondents in the state that knows him best listed him as their top pick in a hypothetical primary contest, behind former President Donald Trump at 47% and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis at 13%.

Jumping in after Virginia¡¯s election would mean missing deadlines to get on the ballot in several key states, including Nevada and South Carolina, which come early in the nominating process. 

Asked about a White House bid in a Fox Business interview last week, Youngkin said he wasn¡¯t ¡°paying attention to the filing deadlines, etc. I¡¯m paying attention to making sure we hold our House and flip our Senate.¡±

Alice Stewart, an aide to Texas Sen. Ted Cruz¡¯s 2016 presidential campaign, said a strong showing in Virginia would set Youngkin up for success in future runs, including a 2028 bid for president. His joining the 2024 race, she said, would just end up ¡°fracturing the field even further; it doesn¡¯t help us get Trump out of the picture. As a matter of fact, it helps him.¡± 

Republican voter Gary Libby wants Youngkin to remain governor through 2025. He said tax cuts implemented under Youngkin are netting him $1,800 to $2,200 a year. He said he supports the governor¡¯s proposed 15-week abortion limit with exceptions for rape, incest and to protect the mother¡¯s life.

¡°He¡¯s delivered on every campaign promise he¡¯s been able to that the Democrats haven¡¯t blocked,¡± said Libby, 62, who lives in a Richmond suburb and sells professional services and software.

But independent voter Robin Menefee, 69, who voted for Biden in 2020 and Youngkin in 2021, said she would cast ballots for Democrats this fall because she opposes curbing abortion access. Current Virginia law allows abortion until about 26 weeks and thereafter only if the mother¡¯s life or health is at serious risk. 

¡°I don¡¯t think the government has the right to step in and tell a woman what she should do with her body,¡± said Menefee, a retiree from the town of Rocky Mount. 

A Christopher Newport poll last fall found that a majority of Virginians opposed the Supreme Court¡¯s 2022 decision overturning Roe v. Wade and two-thirds felt abortion should be legal in all or most cases. Yet the same poll found about half of voters supported banning abortion after 15 weeks with the exceptions Youngkin endorses.

Democrats, meanwhile, have proposed a state constitutional amendment that would guarantee abortion access, ¡°unless justified by a compelling state interest and achieved by the least restrictive means that do not infringe an individual¡¯s autonomous decision-making.¡± The measure said a state interest would be compelling only ¡°to ensure the protection of the health of an individual seeking care.¡± Republicans have criticized that proposal as extreme and out of step with what Virginians want.

Don Scott, Democratic leader in the Virginia House, said he thinks fears of losing abortion access will drive many voters to the polls. He said while Youngkin backs a 15-week limit, the governor previously said he would sign any bill restricting abortion access. 

¡°Every day they¡¯re talking about abortion out there is a good day for us,¡± Scott said.",WSJ

Bernalillo County Sheriff John Allen denounced Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham¡¯s (D-NM) decision last week that would impose penalties on anyone lawfully carrying a firearm in the state¡¯s most populous county in response to what she called an epidemic of gun violence.

¡°The temporary ban challenges the foundations of our Constitution, but most importantly, it is unconstitutional. My oath was to protect the Constitution, and that is what I will do,¡± Allen said.

The sheriff provided other reasons for not upholding the governor¡¯s executive order, including a personal story. . . .

¡°Last week, as I¡¯m sitting here as the sitting sheriff, I get a phone call that my brother also was a victim of gun violence last week that many of you do not know,¡± Allen said. ¡°He and my nephew were sitting in their car when they were shot at, and their vehicle was impacted by numerous rounds. How can I, as a sheriff, tell him to put his firearms away and not be able to protect himself?¡±",WSJ
https://www.wsj.com/politics/why-tribalism-took-over-our-politics-5936f48e?mod=Searchresults_pos7&page=1,2023-08-26,Why Tribalism Took Over Our Politics,"Ahead of his arrest on Thursday in Georgia, Donald Trump repeatedly told his supporters about the legal peril he faced from charges of election interference. But the danger wasn¡¯t his alone, he said. ¡°In the end, they¡¯re not coming after me. They¡¯re coming after you,¡± he told a campaign rally.

It was the latest example of the Republican former president employing a potent driver of America¡¯s partisan divide: group identity. Decades of social science research show that our need for collective belonging is forceful enough to reshape how we view facts and affect our voting decisions. When our group is threatened, we rise to its defense.

The research helps explain why Trump has solidified his standing as the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination despite facing four indictments since April. The former president has been especially adept at building loyalty by asserting that his supporters are threatened by outside forces. His false claims that he was the rightful winner of the 2020 election, which have triggered much of his legal peril, have been adopted by many of his supporters.

Democrats are using the tactic, too, if not as forcefully as Trump. The Biden campaign criticized Republicans in Wednesday¡¯s presidential debate as ¡°extreme candidates¡± who would undermine democracy, and President Biden himself has accused ¡°MAGA Republicans¡± of trying to destroy our systems of government. 

The split in the electorate has left many Americans fatigued and worried that partisanship is undermining the country¡¯s ability to solve its problems. Calling themselves America¡¯s ¡°exhausted majority,¡± tens of thousands of people have joined civic groups, with names such as Braver Angels, Listen First and Unify America, and are holding cross-party conversations in search of ways to lower the temperature in political discourse.

Yet the research on the power of group identity suggests the push for a more respectful political culture faces a disquieting challenge. The human brain in many circumstances is more suited to tribalism and conflict than to civility and reasoned debate.

The differences between the parties are clearer than before. Demographic characteristics are now major indicators of party preference, with noncollege white and more religious Americans increasingly identifying as Republicans, while Democrats now win most nonwhite voters and a majority of white people with a college degree.

¡°Instead of going into the voting booth and asking, ¡®What do I want my elected representatives to do for me,¡¯ they¡¯re thinking, ¡®If my party loses, it¡¯s not just that my policy preferences aren¡¯t going to get done,¡¯ ¡± said Lilliana Mason, a Johns Hopkins University political scientist. ¡°It¡¯s who I think I am, my place in the world, my religion, my race, the many parts of my identity are all wrapped up in that one vote.¡±

Trump, in responding to his indictment in Georgia for conspiring to overturn his 2020 loss in that state, amplified the sense of threat by telling a party gathering that they were engaged in a ¡°final battle¡± that he described as ¡°an epic struggle to rescue our country from the sinister forces within who hate it.¡± The criminal prosecutions, his campaign said in a fundraising email Thursday, were designed ¡°to intimidate you out of voting to save your country.¡±

More than 60% of Republicans and more than half of Democrats now view the other party ¡°very unfavorably,¡± about three times the shares when Pew Research Center polled on it in the early 1990s. Several polls find that more than 70% within each party think the other party¡¯s leaders are a danger to democracy or back an agenda that would destroy the country.

Party allegiance can affect our judgment and behavior, many experiments show. When Shanto Iyengar of Stanford University and Sean J. Westwood, then at Princeton University, asked a group of Democrats and Republicans to review the r?sum?s of two fictitious high-school students in a 2015 study, their subjects proved more likely to award a scholarship to the student who matched their own party affiliation. People in the experiment gave political party more weight than the student¡¯s race or even grade-point average.

In a landmark 2013 study, Dan Kahan, a Yale University law professor, and colleagues assessed the math skills of about 1,000 adults, a mix of self-described liberals, conservatives and moderates. Then, the researchers gave them a politically inflected math problem to solve, presenting data that pointed to whether cities that had banned concealed handguns experienced a decrease or increase in crime. In half the tests, solving the problem correctly showed that a concealed-carry ban reduced crime rates. In the other half, the correct solution would suggest that crime had risen.

The result was striking: The more adept the test-takers were at math, the more likely they were to get the correct answer?but only when the right answer matched their political outlook. When the right answer ran contrary to their political stance?that is, when liberals drew a version of the problem suggesting that gun control was ineffective?they tended to give the wrong answer. They were no more likely to solve the problem correctly than were people in the study who were less adept at math.

To explain why the animosity in American politics is greater today than in the past, some researchers have focused on the nation¡¯s political ¡°sorting¡±?the fact that Americans have shifted their allegiances so that the membership of each party is now far more uniform. In the past, each party had a mix of people who leaned conservative and liberal, rural residents and urbanites, the religiously devout and those less observant.

Data from the General Social Survey, a 50-year public opinion study run by NORC, a nonpartisan research group, shows that this is less the case today. Americans in the past were more likely to meet people different than themselves, which created opportunities for reducing group bias and creating conditions for compromise.

Today, our partisan identities have come into alignment with the other facets of our identity, which heightens our intolerance of each other even beyond our actual political disagreements, Mason said. Political party has become a ¡°mega-identity,¡± she said, magnifying a voter¡¯s political allegiances and amplifying the biases that innately come from belonging to a group.

¡°When you go to cast a ballot, whatever part of your identity is under the most threat is going to influence your choice the most,¡± Mason said.

Researchers have been trying to use what they have learned about social identity to develop tactics to diminish hostility between the parties.

One recent experiment led by Stanford researchers showed 25 messages to a large set of Americans, and then assessed their views of the opposite political party and other attitudes. The tested ¡°interventions¡± included videos and quizzes intended to show that many people within each party hold centrist views on policy and exaggerate the presence of hard-line views among the other party. 

The strategies that worked best at reducing partisan animosity essentially modeled good behavior, highlighting what Democrats and Republicans have in common as Americans or presenting people making a good-faith effort to understand someone with differing views, said Robb Willer, a Stanford sociologist who led the research. But follow-up work showed that the effects diminished over time.

Researchers tested a TV ad that featured both Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, a Republican, and his Democratic opponent for governor in 2020, Chris Peterson, in which they committed to honoring the presidential election results. Cox last month began a one-year term as chairman of the National Governors Association and said he would devote much of the year to promoting civility in politics through a ¡°Disagree Better¡± program that draws on the Stanford research.

Willer said the most effective messages might be broadcast at an important time in the election calendar, or used in school civics classes.

¡°It¡¯s a bit of a David and Goliath situation, to be sure,¡± Willer said. ¡°All the more reason to invent a slingshot.¡±",WSJ

Growing up in the white collar, commuter suburbs of Chicago in the 1950s and early ¡¯60s, guns were a common and accepted thing (¡°The Heroes of Nashville,¡± Review & Outlook, March 30). It was normal to walk into a friend¡¯s house and see shotguns and rifles racked on the wall in the den, and it seemed that every other house had a World War II surplus M-1, Lee-Enfield, Mosin-Nagant or some other real ¡°weapon of war¡± in the closet.

I learned to shoot in high school. There were no background checks, waiting periods or licensing requirements. People, at least in the rural areas, where pickup trucks were a working vehicle and had not yet become a fashion statement, routinely drove around with a rifle and shotgun racked up in the back of their truck without worrying about them being stolen.

Mass shootings, school shootings and teenagers shooting up the shopping center were unheard of. Homicide rates were stable and low. Then it all started to change in the late 1960s and ¡¯70s. Shootings increased and with that came more gun control. Nevertheless, even more gruesome shootings followed. Somewhere along the line, the soul of America had sickened. Some people decided that the solution to their problem, whatever it might be, was to go out and shoot someone.

Until we can figure out a way, as individuals and as a society, to purge this sickness from our hearts and the soul of America, the shootings will continue?regardless of all the mobbing of state capitals, demanding action on the flavor-of-the-month idea for gun control.",WSJ

The surprise decision emerged after the plan to target thousands of rifles and shotguns sparked widespread opposition from the governing Liberals¡¯ political allies on gun control, indigenous leaders and gun-rights advocates.

In the aftermath of the Uvalde, Texas, school shooting last May, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau rolled out gun-control legislation that would formally prohibit the purchase, sale or transfer of handguns and introduce a mandatory buyback program for roughly 1,500 firearms banned in 2020 after the deadliest massacre in the country¡¯s history, in the East Coast province of Nova Scotia.

In the fall, Liberal lawmakers introduced amendments that broadened the proposed firearm ban to include thousands of rifles and shotguns. Critics warned the wider ban threatened the livelihood of indigenous and rural communities, whose members rely on hunting for a livelihood and sustenance.

The government on Friday withdrew its wider firearm ban. Marco Mendicino, Canada¡¯s public safety minister, said the government¡¯s focus is on prohibiting assault-style weapons, ¡°not guns commonly used for hunting. Hunting isn¡¯t just a proud Canadian tradition. It¡¯s a way of life for communities across this country.¡±

The earlier version of Canada¡¯s gun-control legislation had the backing of at least two other smaller political parties in Parliament. Under Canada¡¯s current minority Parliament configuration, the Liberals need the support of at least one other party to get legislation.

Following complaints from rural dwellers and indigenous leaders, Canada¡¯s New Democratic Party and Bloc Quebecois said that they didn¡¯t support the broader ban on rifles and shotguns.

Up until recently, the Liberals, led by Mr. Trudeau largely succeeded in deploying gun control as a wedge issue, said Shachi Kurl, president of Angus Reid Institute, a polling organization. The Liberals rely on large urban centers to maintain power, and gun control is popular in those cities, she said. 

¡°The Liberals found themselves in the glue here because of opposition from traditional allies,¡± she said, citing the Assembly of First Nations, an advocacy group for indigenous peoples, and the New Democrats, who have a formal pact with the Liberals to prop up the minority government. ¡°It has not been as clean a wedge as they hoped.¡±

The retreat also comes at a time of low popularity for Mr. Trudeau¡¯s Liberals. Polling this week from Ottawa-based Abacus Data indicated half of voters believe the country is headed in the wrong direction, and Mr. Trudeau¡¯s Liberals trail their traditional rival, the Conservatives, by 8 percentage points, or the biggest gap between the two parties since 2015.

Currently, gun owners in Canada are required to hold a license to purchase and possess a firearm and to buy ammunition. Licenses have to be renewed every five years and are obtained from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The national police force issues such permits if applicants meet certain public-safety criteria and pass a series of tests.

The most recent RCMP information available indicates that there are 2.2 million license holders and 1.2 million firearms registered.",WSJ

Democrat Jay Inslee was voted out of Congress in 1994 after he voted in favor of the federal assault-weapons ban, marking the beginning of a long period during which prohibitions on any type of guns were considered to be a third-rail of American electoral politics.

Last month, Mr. Inslee, who is now the governor of Washington, signed into law a state assault-weapons ban, illustrating a shift on the issue in Democratic-controlled states following a string of mass shootings?including one earlier this month in a Texas mall.

¡°This is now an electorally winning issue,¡± said Mr. Inslee. ¡°This avalanche of shootings¡¦that drip of America¡¯s life at the altar of the AR-15, people have just had a belly full of it.¡± 

Over the past year, Illinois and Delaware have also passed bans, which block the sale and manufacture of AR-15-style rifles like the one used to kill eight people at the Texas mall. Similar legislation is being reviewed by legislative committees in Rhode Island. 

The last states to pass such a ban were Maryland and New York in 2013, following the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre. Connecticut also strengthened its law that year.

Ten states, all heavily Democratic, now have an assault-weapons ban. 

The issue is another that divides Democratic and GOP-led states in the U.S., as partisan control of state governments has become more common.

State bans generally prohibit new sales of semiautomatic weapons like AR-15s and AK-47s by name. They also typically prohibit semiautomatic weapons that have detachable magazines and specific features like a pistol grip or flash hider. Owners of such guns are generally able to keep them, though in some states they must register them.

Gun-rights advocates argue that such firearms shouldn¡¯t be called ¡°assault weapons¡± because that term is more accurately used to describe military weapons capable of automatic fire. 

Over the years, gun makers have changed the names of their products or removed the offending features to continue selling them in states where such prohibitions exist.

In 2021, a group of firearm violence researchers found that state assault-weapons bans weren¡¯t associated with lower rates of mass shootings. 

¡°The features that define an ¡®assault weapon¡¯ aren¡¯t necessarily relevant to the actual lethality of the firearm,¡± the researchers wrote.

The researchers did find that laws limiting magazine capacity were associated with lower death and injury tolls in mass shootings. 

Gun-control advocates argue that the increase in mass shootings following the end of the federal assault-weapons ban in 2004 shows that such laws are effective. 

Democrats behind the measures say that the growing anger over mass shootings with AR-15-style rifles, a weakened National Rifle Association, and the emergence of well-funded gun-control groups is behind the shift. State lawmakers have also been bolstered by calls from President Biden to ban such guns. 

Gun-rights groups, which are fighting such bans in court with some success, say it is a sign of a more polarized country in which Democrats are comfortable pursuing more strident gun-control measures where they control state legislatures.

Washington state is a microcosm of the changing landscape. When state Sen. Jamie Pedersen joined the legislature more than a decade ago, Democrats in swing districts were loath to back any gun-control efforts, especially bans on an entire class of firearms. They feared gun owners would vote them out.

¡°You worried that you were going to make your re-election more complicated by angering a constituency that was perceived to be well-resourced and passionate,¡± said Mr. Pedersen, a Democrat who represents Seattle. 

That has changed, he said, as Democrats have lost seats in rural areas with more gun voters and taken more suburban seats from Republicans. In addition, pro-gun-control organizations with significant resources like Everytown for Gun Safety, which is backed by billionaire former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, have supported candidates and legislation.

¡°Now, they feel that there are well-resourced organizations that are going to be there to support them and the NRA has turned out to be a paper tiger,¡± Mr. Pedersen said of state Democrats.

The NRA has been beset by legal and financial problems in recent years. The group¡¯s top officials are battling allegations of self-enrichment by New York state¡¯s attorney general, which they have denied. 

Amy Hunter, a spokeswoman for the NRA, said the gun group hasn¡¯t been weakened. 

¡°That¡¯s wishful thinking on the part of the gun-control lobby,¡± she said. ¡°These bans are unconstitutional and do not stand up to scrutiny from the courts.¡±

Brandon Combs, chief executive of the Firearms Policy Coalition, which is fighting the Illinois and Washington bans in court, said it is a sign of Democrats tightening their grip on legislatures in some states. ¡°What¡¯s the political cost of running these extreme gun-control measures?¡± said Mr. Combs. ¡°It¡¯s very low in some of these states that are farther and farther left.¡± 

Mr. Combs said he¡¯s confident that the courts will overturn the new laws. In 2021, a federal judge threw out California¡¯s assault-weapons ban, a ruling that was vacated and sent back to the same judge by an appeals court. The Supreme Court is expected to act soon on an emergency request by gun advocates to temporarily block the Illinois law while litigation proceeds in lower courts.

National support to reinstate the federal assault-weapons ban, which was in place from 1994 to 2004, has waned in recent years. A Quinnipiac University poll from February found that 48% of registered voters opposed a ban while 47% supported it. In 2018, shortly after the Parkland, Fla., high-school massacre, another Quinnipiac poll found that 67% of Americans favored a federal ban and 29% were against it.

OTTAWA?Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau¡¯s push to further tighten the country¡¯s gun-control rules has stalled over a last-minute attempt to prohibit rifles and shotguns widely used by hunters.

The legislation, rolled out following the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, in May that killed 19 children and two teachers, would formally prohibit the purchase, sale or transfer of handguns, and introduce a mandatory buyback program for roughly 1,500 firearms banned in 2020 after the deadliest massacre in the country¡¯s history, in the East Coast province of Nova Scotia.

Liberal Party lawmakers recently added further measures that propose banning thousands of rifles and shotguns. Gun-rights advocates and firearms-policy experts say the bill now represents the largest single prohibition of firearms in the country¡¯s history, and opponents of the legislation say it will affect hunters, even though Mr. Trudeau said they would be exempt.

The additions, approved at a parliamentary committee last month, prohibit firearms capable of accepting magazines that can hold more than five rounds; and firearms capable of discharging ammunition like a semiautomatic, whereby a round is fired with each pull of the trigger. Critics say that, by leaning on the word ¡°capable,¡± the amendments capture a range of firearms that weren¡¯t previously restricted.

This has prompted hunting associations, gun-rights groups, indigenous leaders?and even a prominent player on Mr. Trudeau¡¯s favorite hockey team?to voice their displeasure. Opposition parties in the Canadian legislature, which backed the previous version of the bill, have withdrawn their support in response to anger from constituents in rural and remote communities.

¡°We use rifles to hunt,¡± said Caroline Cochrane, the premier of the Northwest Territories, a region in northern Canada that extends above the Arctic Circle. She said she opposes Mr. Trudeau¡¯s proposal ¡°because then I would be supporting people starving.¡±

Matt Hipwell, the owner of sporting-goods store Wolverine Supplies in Verdin, Manitoba, about 75 miles north of the U.S. border, said the proposed ban would cover some of the most widely owned and popular rifles?like the relatively low-cost, Russian-designed SKS?used by livestock farmers to kill vermin and hunters targeting moose and elk.

¡°They say that this is going to enhance public safety and make Canadians safer, when all this has done is go after firearms from legal firearms owners,¡± Mr. Hipwell said. He said the government is likely pandering to the Canadian ¡°who knows very little about the firearms industry.¡±

Members of the Assembly of First Nations, an advocacy group for indigenous communities across Canada, voted earlier this month to oppose the government¡¯s plan. ¡°These guns are not weapons. They¡¯re tools,¡± said Chief Russell Wesley of the Cat Lake First Nation indigenous community in northern Ontario.

Currently, gun owners in Canada are required to hold a license to purchase and possess a firearm and buy ammunition. Licenses have to be renewed every five years and are obtained from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The national police force issues such permits if applicants meet certain public-safety criteria and pass a series of tests.

The most recent RCMP data available indicate there are 2.2 million licenseholders and 1.2 million firearms registered.

Gun-related homicides in Canada, on a per capita basis, rose in 2021 to their highest level in nearly three decades, according to Statistics Canada, the national data-gathering agency. Nearly 300, or roughly 40%, of the 788 Canadian homicides recorded in 2021 involved the use of a firearm, with the bulk of the murders tied to gang violence, the agency said. Among firearm-related homicides, handguns were the primary type of weapon used at 57%, followed by rifles and shotguns, at 26%.

¡°Other than using firearms for sport shooting and hunting, there is no reason anyone in Canada should need guns in their everyday lives,¡± Mr. Trudeau said in late May in unveiling the new gun laws, which he first promised during the 2019 election campaign.

Canada Public Safety Minister Marco Mendicino said officials will review the revised legislation in the new year. He said the amendment was intended to create a standard definition for prohibited firearms.

¡°We recognize there is a need to ensure that the language of the amendment aligns with the intent of the government?which is to target military-grade firearms which have no place in our community and were designed for the battlefield,¡± Mr. Mendocino said in an interview, adding he wants to ¡°avoid any inadvertent overreach.¡±

Wendy Cukier, president of the Toronto-based Coalition for Gun Control, said the government could consider an exemption for indigenous communities?but the thrust of amendments should be kept intact.

¡°The fact that a firearm is used for hunting doesn¡¯t make it a hunting rifle,¡± she said, adding the government is ¡°going after semiautomatic military-style weapons, and one of their principal characteristics is they are designed for large-capacity magazines.¡±

Past polling suggests gun-control measures are popular, in particular in urban centers where the governing Liberals tend to dominate. A poll from earlier in 2022, from the Angus Reid Institute, indicated 43% of Canadians said they were concerned that gun crime was rising in their community. And roughly the same share of Canadians said gun-control laws needed to be tightened further.

Perhaps the highest-profile opposition emerged from Carey Price, a goaltender with the Montreal Canadiens of the National Hockey League. He posted on his Instagram account?accompanied by a photo of himself donning hunting camouflage and holding a rifle?that, ¡°I am not a criminal or a threat to society.¡±",WSJ

Sen. Chris Murphy (D., Conn.), a longtime proponent of gun control in the Senate, reintroduced the Background Check Expansion Act on Thursday, a bill that would expand federal background checks to all gun sales and private transfers between individuals. Bipartisan legislation last year expanded checks for buyers under 21 years old. 

¡°Requiring a background check for every sale or transfer of a firearm would save thousands and thousands of lives,¡± Mr. Murphy said. 

The reintroduction of the bill follows a shooting at an El Paso, Texas, mall Wednesday night that killed one and left three wounded. The shooting took place steps away from the site of another mass shooting in 2019 that killed 23 people. It also comes days after another shooting on the campus of Michigan State University left three students dead and five wounded. 

Forty-seven members of the Democratic caucus have signed on as co-sponsors of the bill, including Sens. Angus King (I., Maine) and freshman Sen. John Fetterman (D., Pa.). Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick (R., Pa.) and Mike Thompson (D., Calif.) have introduced companion legislation in the House. 

The bill faces headwinds in both the Republican-controlled House, where it is unlikely to get a vote, and the Senate, where 60 votes are needed to advance the bill, requiring bipartisan support. 

Many Republican senators who voted for last year¡¯s Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, a narrow legislative compromise that expanded background checks and increased funding for mental-health and community initiatives, declined to comment Thursday on Mr. Murphy¡¯s bill.

¡°Not yet,¡± said Sen. Joni Ernst (R., Iowa), a member of Republican leadership who backed bipartisan legislation last year, when asked if she had initial thoughts on the bill. 

Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.), who voted against the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, voiced some openness to gun legislation, but voiced his frustration with provisions to expand background checks. 

¡°The problem is all these people that are doing these things are all passing background checks,¡± he said Thursday. ¡°Background checks only tell you what they¡¯ve done. They don¡¯t tell you what they¡¯re going to do.¡±

Some centrists in the Senate Democratic caucus haven¡¯t embraced the proposal. Sen. Jon Tester (D., Mont.) and Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.), both of whom are facing tough re-election battles in 2024, haven¡¯t signed on to Mr. Murphy¡¯s bill. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (I., Ariz.), who is also up for re-election, hasn¡¯t backed the bill either. 

Mr. Tester said Thursday he hadn¡¯t seen Mr. Murphy¡¯s bill, but would back ¡°common sense background check bills to keep the guns out of the hands of criminals.¡± 

Mr. Manchin voiced support for his own proposal. ¡°I¡¯m still in support of Manchin-Toomey, and I always have been,¡± Mr. Manchin said, referring to a proposal he introduced with former Sen. Pat Toomey (R., Pa.) back in 2013 that would have required background checks for guns purchased on the internet and at gun sales. The Manchin-Toomey amendment has failed to clear the Senate every time it has been introduced.",WSJ

Tennessee¡¯s Republican-led House of Representatives expelled two Democratic lawmakers Thursday, a rare punishment for speaking out of turn on the House floor following last week¡¯s mass shooting at a Nashville school.

The House voted Thursday afternoon to force out Justin Jones and Justin Pearson, two of three lawmakers who spoke about gun control. Lawmakers failed to get the two-thirds majority needed to expel their colleague Rep. Gloria Johnson.

Republican members drafted the resolutions to punish the three Democrats for ¡°disorderly behavior¡± after they interrupted a House session on March 30. The members said the trio had broken rules about preserving order and displaying political messages.

¡°One week ago we had members take it upon themselves to rush the well and stop the people¡¯s businesses,¡± said Republican Rep. Johnny Garrett on the House floor Thursday. ¡°What happened one week ago is that the members that shut the order of this institution down silenced seven million people.¡±

Before the vote, Mr. Jones called the proposed expulsions a ¡°power grab.¡±

¡°The world is watching Tennessee because what is happening here today is a farce of democracy,¡± Mr. Jones said. 

State legislators can be expelled from the Tennessee House or Senate under the state¡¯s constitution as long as two-thirds of their chamber votes for the expulsion. The House voted on the expulsions after a heated and lengthy debate on Thursday. The first vote, for Mr. Jones, was 72-25. Lawmakers then voted on a motion to expel Ms. Johnson. Chants of ¡°Gloria!¡± erupted when the motion failed by a single vote, 65-30.

After Mr. Pearson was expelled in a 69-26 vote, chants of ¡°Shame on you!¡± filled the room. 

The House has a Republican supermajority with 75 Republicans and 23 Democrats. The House and Senate only work part-time.

The three Democrats stood at a podium for about five minutes on March 30 with a sign that said, ¡°Protect kids not guns.¡± Some chanted ¡°no action, no peace,¡± while protesters yelled outside the House chamber. Ms. Johnson said Thursday she didn¡¯t raise her voice or use a bullhorn to speak.

¡°There comes a time when you have to do something out of the ordinary,¡± Mr. Jones said on Twitter. ¡°We occupied the House floor today after repeatedly being silenced from talking about the crisis of mass shootings.¡±

In addition to the protest on the House floor, they joined demonstrators in the chamber and outside the state Capitol in Nashville.

In their drafted resolutions, the Republicans allege that the three Democrats ¡°did knowingly and intentionally bring disorder and dishonor to the House of Representatives through their individual and collective actions.¡±

President Biden criticized the vote on Thursday.

¡°Today¡¯s expulsion of lawmakers who engaged in peaceful protest is shocking, undemocratic, and without precedent,¡± he said. ¡°Rather than debating the merits of the issue, these Republican lawmakers have chosen to punish, silence, and expel duly-elected representatives of the people of Tennessee.¡±

Messrs. Jones and Pearson, who are Black, and Ms. Johnson, who is white, didn¡¯t return comment requests. They have started referring to themselves as ¡°the Tennessee three.¡± They walked into the House chamber on Thursday morning with their fists in the air as protesters cheered for them, according to videos on social media.

It is unusual for any U.S. state legislature to expel a member. Thursday¡¯s vote in the Tennessee House marks what appears to be the first time a state lawmaker has been kicked out of a legislature after a gun-control debate. The state attorney general¡¯s office said the Tennessee House has previously expelled members three times in its history: in 1866 ¡°for the contempt of the authority of this House,¡± in 1980 for accepting a bribe and in 2016 after a representative was accused of sexual misconduct.

With Messrs. Jones and Pearson now expelled, election officials are required under Tennessee law to hold a special election to replace them. The Democrats could run for their old seats again.

State Democrats and thousands of protesters have been pressuring Tennessee Republican leaders to make it harder to buy guns following the state¡¯s most high-profile mass shooting in years. Six people, including three children, were killed in the late March shooting at a private Christian school. The shooter had legally obtained the guns used at the school and fired more than 100 rounds in roughly 15 minutes, authorities said. 

Republican supermajorities in the Tennessee legislature have expanded gun access in recent years. State Democrats said in the wake of the mass shooting last week that they planned to renew efforts to propose gun control measures that haven¡¯t been adopted. One of the potential measures is a red-flag law, which would let authorities take away guns from people who a court deems dangerous.

House leaders stripped the protesting Democrats from their committee assignments last week for disrupting the floor session, House Speaker Cameron Sexton told reporters Monday.

Mr. Sexton, a Republican, didn¡¯t return a comment request but said on Twitter Monday that the three Democrats had acted unacceptably.

Legislators from other states and organizations including the American Civil Liberties Union have criticized the attempts to expel the three Democrats. State Innovation Exchange, a progressive group, arranged for hundreds of U.S. state lawmakers to sign a letter to Speaker Sexton condemning the potential expulsions.

The ACLU in Tennessee said, ¡°Attempting to expel three lawmakers without due process for amplifying the voices of their constituents in a peaceful, nonviolent manner undermines democracy.¡± ",WSJ

While Second Amendment advocates have funded academic studies and research before, the new Firearms Research Center at the University of Wyoming is the first venture of its kind at an academic institution in recent decades, according to gun researchers.

Most other gun research at universities is funded by the government or private foundations, as well as gun-control supporters in some instances.

Its opening comes amid a renewed debate over gun control following a recent pair of mass shootings in California and a rise in gun violence during the first two years of the pandemic.

The Firearms Research Center¡¯s founders, law professor George Mocsary and gun historian Ashley Hlebinsky, declined to disclose the names of their backers or how much money had been donated. They said the center, which also includes an additional law professor and a researcher, will offer public lectures and a website with legal scholarship and exhibits on firearms history. 

They said they hope to research issues including how to prevent suicides involving firearms, and to hold symposia on gun-policy issues that include people such as hunters, members of the military and law-enforcement officers.

¡°To have credibility, we have to welcome all voices,¡± said Mr. Mocsary, who has previously done research and written articles opposing some gun regulations and arguing that the Second Amendment protects an individual¡¯s right to bear arms. ¡°It¡¯s important for this to be an ongoing conversation, not just when a tragedy happens.¡±

Business interests in the U.S. such as the tobacco, oil and tech industries have previously sponsored academic research in an effort to sway public and political opinion of their products.

Mr. Mocsary and Ms. Hlebinsky said donations from gun-industry executives won¡¯t influence their work.

Researchers on gun violence and gun policy from other universities said such donations raise questions about the center¡¯s impartiality.

¡°I would hold an industry-funded center for research on firearms with the same level of respect that I would hold for a tobacco industry-funded center for research on the effects and use of tobacco,¡± said Garen Wintemute, director of California Firearm Violence Research Center at the University of California, Davis, which is funded by the state of California. 

The California center was founded in 2017 and has produced studies on the effectiveness of gun policies, including one showing that California¡¯s red-flag law was used 58 times between 2016 and 2018 to temporarily seize guns from individuals threatening mass shootings.

Academics who believe existing research is biased toward gun control welcomed the new center. Robert Leider, an assistant law professor at George Mason University, said at other centers researching guns and gun violence, ¡°if you look at what their scholars are doing, it¡¯s all pro gun-control¡¦There is very much a need for a center that goes in the opposite way.¡±

Mr. Leider is a legal scholar who has argued for a broader interpretation of the Second Amendment and for societal benefits of civilian gun ownership.

Mr. Leider and others who believe existing firearms research is biased in favor of regulation often point to the gun-research center at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, which bears the name of Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York and a prominent gun-control advocate. A spokeswoman for the university said funders don¡¯t influence its researchers¡¯ work. 

David Yamane, a Wake Forest University sociologist studying American gun culture, said he hoped the center in Wyoming would work to include differing views when holding conferences or producing research. But he worried it might become just a resource for gun-rights advocates to turn to bolster their arguments.

¡°I do feel like it¡¯s going to be a he said-he said or they said-they said situation,¡± he said of the work the Firearms Research Center will produce compared with that from other academic institutions.

Research into gun ownership, gun violence and the effectiveness of public policy was limited for many years because of lack of public funding. After Congress passed a provision in 1996 forbidding the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from advocating for gun control, the CDC cut its funding for research on the topic.

In 2018, after a string of mass shootings, Congress clarified that the CDC could fund impartial research. With increased government and private funding, more research is being conducted than ever before, scholars say.",WSJ

A federal judge issued a second ruling against New York¡¯s new gun-control law and blocked its prohibitions on carrying concealed firearms in parks, bars and houses of worship.

U.S. District Judge Glenn T. Suddaby in Syracuse said in a 184-page ruling that many aspects of New York¡¯s law placed an unconstitutional burden on gun rights protected by the Second Amendment. He issued a preliminary injunction that barred the state from enforcing an array of restrictions and rules, including ones that required gun-permit applicants to demonstrate good moral character and provide information about their family members and social-media accounts.

The new permitting system, the Concealed Carry Improvement Act, took effect Sept. 1.

New York lawmakers passed the new measures after the U.S. Supreme Court in June struck down the state¡¯s previous permitting regime, which required applicants to show ¡°proper cause¡± to be allowed to carry a concealed weapon. In a 6-3 decision, the high court said that for gun regulations to pass constitutional muster, they needed to be consistent with the nation¡¯s historical tradition of firearm regulation.

Under the new law, concealed-carry applicants in New York no longer had to demonstrate a special need for self-protection. But they still had to show state licensing officers that they have ¡°good moral character¡± to be entrusted with a weapon.

The law also came with a list of locations where possession of a firearm is a felony regardless of permit status, such as restaurants, trains, buses, parks, theaters, stadiums, bars and New York City¡¯s Times Square.

Judge Suddaby, an appointee of President George W. Bush, said some of the prohibitions were disproportionately burdensome compared with laws enacted in cities and states during the 19th century. He barred the state from enforcing bans on carrying firearms in houses of worship, public parks, zoos, bars and restaurants that serve alcohol, conference centers, theaters and ¡°any gathering of individuals to collectively express their constitutional rights to protest or assemble.¡±

The judge declined to block restrictions on firearms in certain locations including playgrounds. And he said the plaintiffs hadn¡¯t demonstrated they had standing to challenge restrictions in other locations, including New York City¡¯s subway system and the area around Times Square.

His ruling follows a temporary restraining order he issued against the law on Oct. 6. An appeals court, at the state¡¯s request, had allowed the New York law to remain in force on an interim basis while a next round of legal proceedings was pending.

Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat who championed the law, is reviewing the decision, a spokeswoman said. 

The ruling comes as Ms. Hochul has touted the law in her campaign for a full-term as governor. Her Republican opponent, U.S. Rep. Lee Zeldin, said the law is unconstitutional and unfairly affects law-abiding gun owners.

The lawsuit was brought by six men represented by Gun Owners of America, a gun-rights advocacy group.

¡°We are excited to see Kathy Hochul finally served a plate of humble pie, and we are fully prepared to continue the fight should she again attempt to disarm the citizens of her state,¡± Erich Pratt, the group¡¯s senior vice president, said in a statement.",WSJ

The former representatives, Justin Jones and Justin Pearson, and their colleague, Democratic Rep. Gloria Johnson, interrupted a House session for several minutes on March 30 to call on their Republican counterparts to act on gun control. Six people were killed in a mass shooting days earlier at a Nashville, Tenn., Christian school. The incident spurred thousands of residents to protest outside the state Capitol, where Republicans have voted to expand gun access in recent years.

The House¡¯s Republican supermajority voted after hours of debates to expel Messrs. Jones and Pearson as punishment for ¡°disorderly behavior.¡± The men were the youngest Black Democrats in the House. The Republicans came one vote shy of the two-thirds majority they needed to oust Ms. Johnson, who is white.

The trio call themselves the ¡°Tennessee three.¡± They didn¡¯t return requests for comment.

Tennessee laws require special elections to replace Messrs. Jones and Pearson. Some local officials have already been moving to reappoint them. 

Here¡¯s what to know.
What did the three Democrats do and why were two of them expelled?

They took the floor during a House session for about five minutes with a bullhorn and a sign that said, ¡°Protect kids not guns.¡± Some chanted ¡°no action, no peace,¡± while protesters gathered outside the House chamber. Ms. Johnson said Thursday she didn¡¯t raise her voice or use a bullhorn to speak.

House Republicans said the three had broken rules about decorum and displaying political messages. Republicans had drafted separate resolutions to expel the three, which the House voted on at the end of its session on Thursday.

The Republicans alleged in the resolutions that the three Democrats ¡°did knowingly and intentionally bring disorder and dishonor to the House of Representatives through their individual and collective actions.¡±

State legislators can be expelled from the Tennessee House or Senate under state law as long as two-thirds of their chamber votes for the expulsion. Republicans have a supermajority in the House, with 75 members outnumbering 21 Democrats.
Who are Justin Jones, Justin Pearson, and Gloria Johnson?

The three were elected to represent parts of Nashville, Memphis and Knoxville, the three largest cities in Tennessee.

Mr. Jones, 27 years old, is a well-known community organizer in Nashville who was elected last year to represent parts of the city. He split his time in the House, where members work part-time, with his studies at Vanderbilt Divinity School, according to his website.

Mr. Pearson is an environmental activist who protested an oil pipeline in Memphis, where his district was. He is the son of a teacher and a preacher and he graduated from Bowdoin College, according to his website. He said during the debates Thursday that he wasn¡¯t entirely familiar with the House rules because he had just taken office earlier this year.

Ms. Johnson, 60 years old, is a retired teacher representing parts of Knoxville, according to her House biography page. She was first elected in 2012. She said Thursday that children once came running to her classroom after a fatal shooting in the cafeteria. She said she was passionate about reforming the state¡¯s gun laws because she could never forget the looks on the children¡¯s faces that day.
How did the three react to the expulsion proceedings?

The House debated each expulsion resolution separately, first expelling Mr. Jones, then voting to retain Ms. Johnson before ousting Mr. Pearson.

Mr. Jones said after he was expelled that he believed the House Republicans had ¡°destroyed democracy.¡±

¡°They expelled the two youngest Black lawmakers for standing with our constituents for demanding that we take action on the crisis of mass shootings,¡± he said.

Ms. Johnson was asked why she thought she wasn¡¯t expelled. ¡°It might have to do with the color of our skin,¡± she said.

Mr. Pearson told reporters Thursday, ¡°We¡¯ll be back.¡± Over the shouts of protesters, he added, ¡°We can never normalize the ending of democracy. We can never normalize the tyranny of the way that these people in positions of power are operating due to white supremacy.¡±
Has the Tennessee House expelled other members before?

It is rare for any U.S. state legislature to expel a member. The state attorney general¡¯s office said the Tennessee House has previously ousted members three times in its history: in 1866 ¡°for the contempt of the authority of this House,¡± in 1980 for accepting a bribe and in 2016 after a representative was accused of sexual misconduct.
What happens next?

The state constitution requires local officials to hold special elections for Messrs. Jones and Pearson¡¯s vacant seats. Officials have to appoint someone to take their positions in the interim.

For Mr. Jones, who represents Nashville, the Metropolitan Council representing the city and its surrounding county is required to appoint someone to replace him in the interim. Many of the council¡¯s 40 members have said they would vote to appoint Mr. Jones during their special meeting on Monday to fill the seat. 

Mr. Pearson represents parts of Memphis, where the Shelby County Board of Commissioners is set to vote for someone to fill his empty seat.

Officials in both Mr. Pearson and Mr. Jones¡¯s districts haven¡¯t said if they have scheduled a special election yet.

Mr. Jones has already begun fundraising for his next political venture, which he hasn¡¯t specified.
How did other politicians react?

Vice President Kamala Harris is set to travel to Nashville Friday to meet Messrs. Jones and Pearson, and Ms. Johnson, said Kirsten Allen, Ms. Harris¡¯s press secretary. She is also set to talk to young activists about gun control.

President Biden criticized the move Thursday, saying, ¡°Today¡¯s expulsion of lawmakers who engaged in peaceful protest is shocking, undemocratic, and without precedent. Rather than debating the merits of the issue, these Republican lawmakers have chosen to punish, silence, and expel duly-elected representatives of the people of Tennessee.¡±

Former President Barack Obama and top Democrats in Tennessee, including Rep. Steve Cohen of Memphis, also condemned the expulsion.",WSJ

Democratic-led states where gun restrictions were upended by a recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling are pushing ahead with new measures to ban concealed weapons from places such as hospitals, parks and houses of worship.

Lawmakers in several states are considering legislation to replace their old permitting regimes, which gave state licensing officials wide latitude to deny permits unless a gun owner could provide sufficient justification for carrying a concealed weapon outside the home. The 6-3 high-court opinion said that New York officials had too much discretion. The court also set a new constitutional test for state and local gun-control measures: They must be consistent with the nation¡¯s historical tradition of firearms regulation.

New York lawmakers enacted a new law a week after the ruling. It changed the criteria for obtaining a license?requiring in-person training as well as disclosure of social-media accounts?and prohibited guns in a number of what it said were sensitive places.

There are nine federal lawsuits challenging the new law, and judges have blocked enforcement of some of the sensitive-place restrictions, according to the state attorney general¡¯s office.

U.S. District Judge Glenn Suddaby, an appointee of George W. Bush sitting in Syracuse, ruled that some of New York¡¯s newly crafted sensitive-place prohibitions were disproportionately burdensome compared with laws enacted in cities and states during the 19th century. His Nov. 7 decision barred the state from enforcing bans on carrying firearms in houses of worship, public parks, zoos, bars and restaurants that serve alcohol, conference centers and theaters. He also struck down a provision that banned guns in privately owned businesses or property unless the owners expressly allowed them.

Judge Suddaby¡¯s preliminary injunction was stayed by the Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals as state lawyers challenged the ruling. Other judges have blocked enforcement of the bans on firearms in houses of worship and on private property.

Andrew Willinger, executive director of the Duke Center for Firearms Law, said the situation in New York showcased the tricky nature of interpreting the Supreme Court decision. For example, Judge Suddaby ruled that firearms could be banned from playgrounds and libraries but not public parks or zoos.

¡°Judges are making up how to implement this test as they go along,¡± said Mr. Willinger. ¡°There¡¯s going to have to be some sort of broader framework on what factors do courts use as opposed to a nose count of historical laws.¡±

In a landmark 2008 opinion, the Supreme Court recognized an individual right to possess a firearm and use it for self-defense in the home, but the court said it wasn¡¯t calling into question laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings. In this summer¡¯s New York ruling, however, the justices said there were limits to how far states and municipalities could go in declaring a range of places as sensitive gun-free zones.

The legal uncertainty in New York hasn¡¯t deterred other jurisdictions from enacting similar laws. Maryland¡¯s Montgomery County last month approved a law that would prohibit firearms within 100 yards of places of public assembly, including hospitals, schools, parks and places of worship. In Hawaii, the Honolulu City Council held the first hearing last week on a bill to prohibit firearms in parks and public transportation facilities, among other places.

State lawmakers in New Jersey are considering a bill that would require applicants for a concealed-weapons permit to complete in-person training and purchase liability insurance. The bill?which was approved last month by the state Assembly and will be considered this week by a Senate committee?would prohibit firearms in more than two-dozen places that lawmakers deemed sensitive, including bars and casinos.

Assemblyman Joe Danielsen, a Democrat from Middlesex County who sponsors the bill, said he watched the legal challenges to New York¡¯s law and opted against mimicking some of its provisions, such as the social-media disclosure or a ban on firearms in houses of worship.

¡°The people sent me to Trenton as a legislator. They did not send me to be a Supreme Court justice,¡± Mr. Danielsen said. ¡°I started this with the attitude that safety is my target, and this bill hits a bull¡¯s-eye.¡±

Evan Nappen, a New Jersey attorney and gun-rights activist, said the legislation was overly broad and would affect lawful gun owners who aren¡¯t committing crimes. ¡°This will not stand. It¡¯s already proven in New York¡¯s experiment with this same garbage,¡± Mr. Nappen said.

Hawaii state Sen. Karl Rhoads, a Democrat, said he would introduce a sensitive-places bill next year but that its exact text will depend on the latest court rulings in New York. In California, state Sen. Anthony Portantino, also a Democrat, said he would reintroduce a bill that failed to gain enough support to pass this summer.

Democratic lawmakers who control both chambers of the Massachusetts Legislature passed a law to bring their firearm-licensing laws in line with the Supreme Court decision, but they haven¡¯t put forward any specific sensitive-place restrictions.

Bill Sack, director of legal operations for the Firearms Policy Coalition, a gun-rights advocacy group, said his organization would continue to challenge sensitive-place restrictions that go beyond the schools and government buildings mentioned by the Supreme Court.

Gun-control advocates said states and localities should move forward despite the uncertainty.

¡°If courts eventually strike down certain provisions, so be it,¡± said Adam Skaggs, chief counsel and policy director for the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. ¡°But if legislators don¡¯t push the envelope and explore the extent of their powers, I think they¡¯re doing themselves and their constituents a disservice.¡±",WSJ

NASHVILLE, Tenn.?The GOP-dominated Tennessee legislature wound down its session Friday evening without taking up a measure to tighten gun-control laws following a mass shooting here, despite a late plea by Republican Gov. Bill Lee.

Mr. Lee backed a proposal that would have allowed police to ask a civil court judge to remove firearms from people who were at risk of hurting themselves or others. Republican leadership blocked it in both chambers, leaving it without a sponsor or a bill number by the time the General Assembly adjourned Friday evening.

A Republican operative at the Capitol who was familiar with the recent discussions on the proposal said Thursday that ¡°it landed with a thud¡± in both chambers. The Tennessee Firearms Association, a gun-rights group, had lobbied against the effort.

¡°It¡¯s dead for the time being,¡± said Richard Archie, a member of the group¡¯s board, on Thursday.

A representative for Mr. Lee didn¡¯t respond to a request for comment.

The lack of progress on gun legislation followed tumultuous weeks in Nashville, after a shooting at a private school that left six dead, including three children. On March 27, a 28-year-old shooter from Nashville who once attended the school shot through a door and entered the school firing at students and staff. Police killed the shooter at the scene.

The shooting triggered large and sustained protests in and around the state Capitol and calls for stricter gun-control laws. The demonstrations, some of the most boisterous Nashville has seen in recent memory, involved three Democratic legislators, two of whom were expelled by Republicans before being reinstated days later by their local governing authorities. The expulsions sparked fury from the three¡¯s supporters in Tennessee and across the country.

Pro-gun-rights groups dismissed the protests as theater and mobilized their supporters to push elected officials for more security around schools and to block passage of any measures such as the one the governor proposed.

The weeks since the shooting have been marked by an outpouring of grief across Tennessee and anger from many in Nashville, a predominantly Democratic city in a state controlled by the Republican Party. Mr. Lee, whose wife knew people killed in the shooting, initially urged caution in responding to the incident. In recent weeks, he has tried to secure passage of legislation that he said could reduce the chances of mass shootings in the future.

Mr. Lee last week signed an executive order requiring courts to quickly report new criminal activity to the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation for updating records in background checks of potential firearm purchasers. He led the way for an approved $140 million bucket in the next budget aimed at bolstering school-security measures, including funding for school resource officers?law-enforcers with arrest powers?at public and private schools. 

And he pushed his party to take on his gun-law proposal, which echoes existing state law around restraining orders and firearm possession. 

¡°Tennesseans are asking us to set aside politics and personal pride, and they are depending on us to do the right thing,¡± Mr. Lee said in a video statement issued Wednesday, adding, ¡°We all agree that dangerous, unstable individuals who intend to harm themselves or others should not have access to weapons.¡±

He eschewed the label ¡°red-flag law,¡± a term which has been applied to similar legislation in other states and which gun-rights advocates have attacked as ill-conceived and unconstitutional. A version of the proposed legislation backed by Mr. Lee, obtained by The Wall Street Journal, outlined a narrower path for the courts to step in than in red-flag laws in other states.

¡°Both sides risk standing in the way of a thoughtful, practical solution,¡± he said. ¡°Why? Politics.¡±

Both chambers have Republican supermajorities?meaning they can override any Democratic legislative move. After Mr. Lee posted his video Wednesday, Tennessee House Republicans tweeted, ¡°Any red flag law is a nonstarter for House Republicans.¡±

A representative for House Speaker Cameron Sexton didn¡¯t respond to a request for comment. Republican Lt. Gov. Randy McNally said after the shooting that he supported a red-flag law. State Sen. Jack Jackson, Republican majority leader in the Senate, didn¡¯t respond to a request for comment.

Earlier this week, President Biden lauded Mr. Lee ¡°for signing an executive order to expand background checks and calling on the legislature to pass a red-flag law.¡±

Steve Gill, a conservative radio commentator in Tennessee, said Mr. Biden¡¯s supportive statement likely undercut the second-term governor. Mr. Lee has ¡°no clout whatsoever with the legislature,¡± Mr. Gill said.

The Metropolitan Nashville Police Department hasn¡¯t released details of a motive in the shooting and is still investigating the case.

Tennessee Democrats, without much power in the minority, have been smarting over the GOP¡¯s resistance to Mr. Lee¡¯s push. The ¡°Tennessee Three,¡± the moniker used by the three Democratic legislators targeted in the GOP¡¯s expulsion effort, are headed to Washington on Monday to meet with Mr. Biden. Those three?State Reps. Justin Jones, Justin Pearson and Gloria Johnson?are expected to push for tougher gun laws. 

¡°It¡¯s morally unacceptable for this legislature to adjourn without even considering common-sense gun legislation,¡± Democratic state Sen. Jeff Yarbro said.",WSJ

WASHINGTON?A 5-4 Supreme Court said Tuesday that federal regulation of so-called ghost guns would stand while the Biden administration appeals lower-court orders finding that do-it-yourself firearm kits weren¡¯t covered by the principal federal weapons law, the Gun Control Act.

The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives issued a rule in 2022 applying the Gun Control Act to gun kits amid a proliferation of such kits being sold over the internet. After lower courts said the rule exceeded the government¡¯s regulatory authority, the Justice Department asked the Supreme Court to let the regulations stand while the litigation continues.

Tuesday¡¯s order, as is typical in emergency matters, was unsigned and provided no reasons. It noted that Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh would have denied the government¡¯s request.

The Justice Department said it was gratified the court permitted the government to continue treating guns assembled from kits like other weapons, at least for now. The rule ¡°is about public safety?helping law enforcement solve crimes and reducing the number of untraceable ghost guns flooding our communities,¡± a spokesman said.

A lawyer for the Firearms Policy Coalition, a gun group that challenged the regulations, said they were ¡°deeply disappointed that the court pressed pause on our defeat of ATF¡¯s rule.¡± The lawyer, Cody Wisniewski, said he remained ¡°confident that we will yet again defeat ATF and its unlawful rule at the Fifth Circuit when that court has the opportunity to review the full merits of our case.¡±

In its Supreme Court filing, the Justice Department said that criminals have used ghost guns as a loophole to frustrate law enforcement. Exempting them from the rules that apply to other guns ¡°poses an acute threat to public safety,¡± the government said. More than 19,000 ghost guns were recovered by police in 2021, a 1,000% increase from 2017, it said, and the number so far this year is 23,000. 

Companies that market such kits, along with consumers who sought to assemble homemade firearms and gun-rights groups, filed suit to block the rule, arguing that it exceeded the Gun Control Act¡¯s scope. A federal district judge in Fort Worth, Texas, Reed O¡¯Connor, agreed, issuing an order in July blocking enforcement of the ghost gun rule.

¡°A weapon parts kit is not a firearm,¡± O¡¯Connor wrote, and ¡°ATF has no general authority to regulate weapon parts.¡± The Fifth U.S. Circuit of Appeals, in New Orleans, agreed to expedite the government¡¯s appeal, but left in place O¡¯Connor¡¯s order blocking enforcement of the ghost-gun regulations that had been challenged.

The Gun Control Act¡¯s provisions are intended to make it easier to keep guns out of the hands of criminals by channeling sales through licensed dealers, and to help law enforcement solve crimes involving guns by requiring that weapons carry serial numbers.

President Lyndon Johnson signed the Gun Control Act in October 1968, after the assassinations earlier that year of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy, along with mounting civil unrest, pushed Congress to move the long-stalled legislation. Among other devices, it covers any weapon that ¡°will or is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive,¡± as well as ¡°the frame or receiver of any such weapon.¡±

In its 2022 rule, the ATF said that regulation includes ¡°a weapon parts kit that is designed to or may readily be completed, assembled, restored, or otherwise converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive.¡± The bureau said the clarification was necessitated by ¡°technological advances¡± that have ¡°made it easier for companies to sell firearm parts kits,¡± which include all the components needed ¡°to complete a functional weapon within a short period of time.¡±

The government argues that it makes no sense to draw a line between an assembled product and a kit that can quickly be put together.

¡°Every speaker of English would recognize that a tax on sales of ¡®bookshelves¡¯ applies to IKEA when it sells boxes of parts and the tools and instructions for assembling them into bookshelves. The court¡¯s insistence on treating guns differently contradicts ordinary usage and makes a mockery of Congress¡¯s careful regulatory scheme,¡± the government¡¯s brief argues.

BlackHawk Manufacturing Group, a ghost-gun maker that challenged the rule, said the government¡¯s IKEA analogy was superficial. In the company¡¯s furniture store analogy, Congress may have decided to tax bookshelves but excluded assemble-them-at-home kits.",WSJ

NASHVILLE?City officials voted to return former state lawmaker Justin Jones to the Tennessee House of Representatives just days after he and a fellow Democratic legislator were removed by the chamber¡¯s Republican leaders.

Less than an hour later, he was sworn in on the statehouse steps and returned to the House floor to reclaim his seat in the state legislature. The move fills the vacant legislature seat until a special election is held.

Mr. Jones, who represented Nashville, and Justin Pearson, who represented parts of Memphis, were last week expelled from the legislature in a rare punishment for speaking out of turn on the House floor. Another Democratic state lawmaker, Rep. Gloria Johnson, narrowly avoided expulsion on the same charges as her freshmen colleagues. 

Messrs. Jones and Pearson, who are Black, and Ms. Johnson, who is white, were accused of disorderly conduct on March 30, following a school shooting that left six dead earlier that week. A 28-year-old suspect killed three students and three adults at a private Christian school in Nashville last month; police killed the shooter at the scene.

Supporters have dubbed the lawmakers the ¡°Tennessee Three¡± after they joined a crowd of demonstrators, mostly local students, who interrupted a House session with chants for several minutes the week of the shooting. They took the opportunity to call on their Republican counterparts to act on gun control. 

Thousands of protesters marching on the Capitol have been pressuring Tennessee Republican leaders to make it harder to buy guns following the state¡¯s most high-profile mass shooting in years. The shooter had legally obtained the guns used at the school and fired more than 100 rounds in roughly 15 minutes, authorities said. 

Republican Gov. Bill Lee and leadership in the GOP-dominated legislature have focused on pushing school-security measures in response but have been resistant to Democratic calls to tighten gun laws. Both state chambers have a Republican supermajority.

Observers on Monday packed the Nashville Metropolitan Council chambers, where the meeting lasted just several minutes, with loud cheers from assembled supporters. After the vote, hundreds of demonstrators walked with Mr. Jones a few blocks uphill to gather in the shadow of the state Capitol. Mr. Jones was sworn in and returned to the House floor.

In a plaza across the street, Jan Sebastian-Hatchett, 65, a retired educator from Nashville, said getting Mr. Jones back in office was just a first step toward pressuring Republicans on gun control.

¡°It is a good start. Because here¡¯s what everybody has seen all over the world: This is something that¡¯s not going to go away,¡± said Ms. Sebastian-Hatchett, who doesn¡¯t live in Mr. Jones¡¯s district but she said felt like he was still her representative based on his gun-control push.

Tennessee¡¯s constitution calls for local legislative bodies to appoint someone to an empty legislature seat in the event of a midterm vacancy, until a special election can be held. In Nashville, the Metro Council acted on behalf of the consolidated city of Nashville and Davidson County, which Mr. Jones¡¯s previous district included. The vote was unanimous, 36-0.

Nashville¡¯s Metro Council held a special meeting Monday after the majority of council members publicly stated they would support reinstating Mr. Jones, who was elected to the seat just last year. In Memphis, the Shelby County Board of Commissioners, with its Democratic majority, is set to vote for someone to fill Mr. Pearson¡¯s seat. 

Tennessee House Speaker Cameron Sexton planned to seat the new appointments from the Nashville and Memphis officials, according to spokesman Doug Kefner. 

¡°The two governing bodies will make the decision as to who they want to appoint to these seats. Those two individuals will be seated as representatives as the Constitution requires,¡± Mr. Kefner said, though he didn¡¯t give a timeline.

Nashville¡¯s council rules set out a four-week process to elect an interim representative, but council members agreed to push Mr. Jones¡¯s appointment faster.

¡°It¡¯s important to remember that this entire spectacle arose from devastating gun violence in Nashville, and I hope the state legislature will focus on bipartisan opportunities like red flag laws rather than absurdist stunts,¡± Freddie O¡¯Connell said ahead of the meeting. Mr. O¡¯Connell, a longtime Metro Council Member who represents much of the city¡¯s downtown area, is also running for mayor.

Expulsion from state legislatures is rare in the U.S. State lawmakers can be expelled from the Tennessee House or Senate under the state¡¯s constitution as long as two-thirds of their chamber votes for the expulsion. President Biden criticized the vote last week, calling it ¡°shocking, undemocratic, and without precedent.¡±

The Tennessee legislature has expanded gun access in recent years. Mr. Lee has pushed expanded legislation supporting security measures in schools, including increasing funding for school resource officers, even at private schools. He has stopped short of saying he supports things such as ¡°red-flag laws,¡± which would allow authorities to take away guns from people that a court deems dangerous, but he said he was open to legislative solutions.",WSJ

Two Tennessee Democrats who were expelled after leading gun-control chants on the floor of the state House of Representatives earlier this year won special elections to officially take back their seats.

The Democrats, Justin Jones and Justin Pearson, handily defeated challengers from other parties Thursday to win back the positions they lost in April, according to election records in Davidson and Shelby counties.

The men gained national profiles after Republicans in Tennessee¡¯s House of Representatives used their majority power to remove them from the chamber, a rare punishment for speaking out of turn on the House floor. Democratic state officials in the Nashville and Memphis metro areas voted to send Jones and Pearson straight back to the House on a temporary basis until Thursday¡¯s special elections.

¡°You can¡¯t expel a Movement! You can¡¯t expel Hope!¡± Pearson said in a tweet early Friday, adding, ¡°We did it!!!!!¡±

Jones and Pearson had been expected to win the elections in majority-Democrat districts that include Nashville and Memphis, respectively. 

Jones, in a Thursday night tweet, said, ¡°Well, Mr. Speaker, the People have spoken. The FIND OUT era of politics is just beginning. See you August 21st for special session.¡±

Jones, Pearson and their colleague Rep. Gloria Johnson had interrupted a House session in March for several minutes to call on their Republican counterparts to enact gun control measures. They later said they wanted to acknowledge the thousands of protesters marching on the state Capitol who were pressuring Republican leaders to make it harder to buy guns. Nashville days earlier had been rocked by a mass shooting that killed six people at a school.

The expulsion drew national attention in part because the Republican House voted to expel Jones and Pearson, who are Black, but not Johnson, their white colleague who narrowly avoided removal. It also highlighted a longstanding power struggle in the state between Republicans who control the government and Democrats in charge of the fast-growing cities.

Johnson said Friday she was glad Jones and Pearson were re-elected.

¡°They were unethically, potentially unconstitutionally, removed and so they are back where they are supposed to be and I am thrilled about it,¡± she said.

Still, the 61-year-old retired teacher said it was unfortunate the special elections cost taxpayers money.

The House¡¯s Republican supermajority sought to reprimand the three Democrats but instead catapulted them onto the national stage. Johnson said she is weighing a U.S. Senate run against Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn, who is up for re-election next year.

¡°A whole lot of people are asking me to do this,¡± said Johnson, who was first elected in 2012 to represent parts of Knoxville.

Jones, Pearson and Speaker Cameron Sexton, the House¡¯s Republican leader, didn¡¯t return requests for comment Friday.

House Republicans previously said the trio¡¯s interruption had broken rules about decorum and displaying political messages.  

Jones, first elected last year, was a well-known political figure in Nashville, in part for staging protests at the Capitol. Pearson, a 28-year-old environmental activist, took office earlier this year.

Democrats and gun-control advocates rallied around the trio, who were dubbed the Tennessee Three. President Biden, former President Barack Obama and top Democrats in Tennessee condemned the expulsion. Jones, Pearson and Johnson visited the White House earlier this year where Biden thanked them for standing up for children and for democratic values.

The two Democrats, Justin Jones and Justin Pearson, were expelled from the House days after they interrupted a session to advocate gun control following a mass shooting here. The House¡¯s Republican supermajority sought to punish the freshman lawmakers for breaking House rules but ended up catapulting the two young men with next to no widespread name ID onto the national stage. They have juggled national TV appearances and a call from President Biden. 

One of their colleagues, Democratic Rep. Gloria Johnson of Knoxville, survived a potential expulsion by one vote. Vice President Kamala Harris met with all three in Nashville last week. Donations poured in supporting the three lawmakers, including $400,000 raised by Sen. Chris Murphy (D., Conn.), a prominent gun-control advocate. Mr. Jones ran into 1960s folk singer and civil-rights activist Joan Baez in an airport Sunday, and the pair sang ¡°We Shall Overcome¡± while holding hands.

Whatever happens next, political observers don¡¯t expect the ¡°Tennessee Three¡± to fade from political view.

¡°All three gained the upper hand in a debate that was meant to crush them and has instead made them,¡± said Lisa Quigley, former chief of staff to former U.S. Rep. Jim Cooper, who represented Tennessee.

On Monday, Mr. Jones was sworn back into the House after Nashville¡¯s Metropolitan Council appointed him to the position on an interim basis until a special election is held, returning triumphantly to the floor with his fist raised. A panel in Memphis could return Mr. Pearson to the House in a vote Wednesday.

Mr. Jones was escorted back to the Capitol alongside hundreds of demonstrators carrying ¡°No Justin, No Peace¡± signs and was sworn back in on the statehouse steps. Because of the timing of the council¡¯s vote, Mr. Jones returned to the House in time to catch the session Monday, the first since he was expelled.

Ms. Johnson joined their protest on the House floor last week, chanting messages such as ¡°No action, no peace,¡± but she said last week she didn¡¯t raise her voice or use a bullhorn to speak. Ms. Johnson is white and Messrs. Jones and Pearson are Black, setting off allegations of racism by some Democrats. Republicans have denied that claim.

State Rep. Jody Barrett, a Republican representing parts of central Tennessee, said last week he rejected the idea that Ms. Johnson stayed in the House because she is white. ¡°That is a preposterous and baseless allegation that is illustrative of the political climate in our country today,¡± he said.

The Tennessee House Republicans have dismissed the three as publicity seekers, calling them ¡°Tennessee Me¡±?a play on the ¡°Tennessee Three¡± moniker. The day Messrs. Jones and Pearson were expelled, House Republicans said in a tweet: ¡°It¡¯s never been about change. Their only interest is being in the spotlight.¡±

Representatives for Mr. Jones, Ms. Johnson and Mr. Pearson didn¡¯t return requests for comment.

Political strategists and analysts in Tennessee say the two men have leveraged their newfound national name recognition to build deeper political support in the state. They said the two men can expand on that in a number of ways: Messrs. Jones and Pearson could run for a congressional office or mayorship, sign book or speaking deals or become influential gun-control advocates, traveling the country to rally support for gun laws. Ms. Quigley said running for an executive office or Congress would give them more power, given Republicans hold a supermajority in Tennessee¡¯s state house. 

Few freshman state legislators get airtime like Messrs. Jones and Pearson got last week, when national news networks carried their expulsion votes?and floor speeches protesting the moves?on live TV. They have since sat down for interviews with ¡°Good Morning America¡± and CNN and are both fundraising on their personal websites.

¡°They¡¯re very young in their careers and have been given a little bit of rocket fuel,¡± said Dr. John Geer, a political-science professor at Vanderbilt University and a co-director of Vanderbilt Poll, which runs surveys in Tennessee.

Mr. Jones is 27 years old and a well-known community organizer in Nashville, where he has called for Medicaid expansion and less restrictive voter ID laws, according to his website. Mr. Pearson is a 28-year-old environmental activist and had taken office earlier this year to represent parts of Memphis.

Dr. Geer said the two men would make strong candidates for a higher office than state legislator. For example, Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R., Tenn.) is up for re-election in 2024. It would be difficult for Messrs. Jones and Pearson to run for statewide office in such a Republican stronghold, Dr. Geer said, though they would be well positioned in a statewide Democratic primary.

In the U.S. House, Nashville doesn¡¯t have a sole representative because of how Tennessee¡¯s state legislature redrew the latest district maps.

Democratic Rep. Steve Cohen, whose congressional district includes Memphis, said Tuesday that the ¡°Tennessee Three¡± have a great opportunity to serve the state, but he doesn¡¯t foresee Mr. Pearson?who was once an intern in his House office?running against him.

¡°This is a platform for which no person, I think, in the General Assembly has ever had to be noticed and have their voice heard and to gain a national constituency,¡± Mr. Cohen said.

Mr. Jones?and possibly Mr. Pearson?is returning to the House with a much bigger platform to call for gun control, a heightened issue in Tennessee following a mass shooting last month in which six people were killed at a Nashville Christian school. The shooter legally obtained the guns used in the shooting, authorities said, killing three students and three adults. Thousands of people in recent weeks have protested at the state Capitol, where Republicans in the past few years have expanded gun access.

Gov. Bill Lee, a Republican, on Tuesday morning said he plans to sign an executive order expanding background checks for firearm purchases.

The new order would require courts to report new criminal activity to the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation within 72 hours, giving authorities more complete information when assessing a potential firearm purchaser. ¡°The existing background check process for purchasing a firearm only works when there is accurate and timely information that¡¯s available,¡± Mr. Lee said.

If Messrs. Jones and Pearson don¡¯t use their newfound stardom to run for higher office, they could still ink lucrative speaking deals, said Isaac Wright, a Democratic political consultant in Nashville.

Mr. Wright said the Tennessee Three¡¯s political opportunity is to link Tennessee to the broader gun-control fight. ¡°I would suggest they look at it from a national platform of gun-safety regulation and pointing out how Tennessee is the worst case scenario,¡± he said.",WSJ

You might say Congresswoman Karen Bass was robbed by reality. After her Baldwin Vista home was burglarized the other week, the progressive Democrat running for Mayor of Los Angeles says she can empathize with residents who fret about rising crime. But as mayor, would she do anything about it?

Ms. Bass has moderated her soft-on-crime views somewhat during the mayoral campaign as her opponent Rick Caruso, a real estate developer, pounds the city¡¯s public safety problems. Robberies are up 18% so far this year from last year. Burglaries (15%) and motor vehicle thefts (14%) have also increased while arrests have declined 11%.

Yet Ms. Bass has often seemed disconnected from the dangerous reality that Angelenos experience on the streets every day. Asked in a debate this spring to rate how safe she felt walking around her neighborhood on a scale from one to 10, she replied: ¡°I would say a 10.¡± This month after her home was broken into, she walked that back.

¡°I did feel safe until my safety was shattered, like so many Angelenos,¡± she told a local news station. The burglars ransacked her home and stole two handguns, which she said were registered and locked in a safe box hidden in her closet. Strangely, the criminals didn¡¯t take cash, electronics or other valuables.

Though she¡¯s a gun-control advocate, Ms. Bass said she kept the ¡°guns for personal safety, as do many people. I think that gun control is extremely important. But I have never believed that people?if they wanted to have guns?should not have them.¡± She can thank the Supreme Court¡¯s Heller decision for protecting her Second Amendment right to protect herself.

Two men were arrested last week for the break-in and, for a change, they are being held in jail rather than released to quickly rob again. One reason L.A. like other big cities has become more dangerous and disorderly is because criminals often aren¡¯t apprehended, and, when they are, they are released back on the streets. Ms. Bass¡¯s website says ¡°we¡¯ve tried arresting our way out of the problem before?it doesn¡¯t work.¡± Actually, it does.",WSJ

Justin Jones and Justin Pearson for disrupting the chamber¡¯s business. Yet it¡¯s astounding to see prominent Democrats now justifying and outright endorsing the pair¡¯s tactic of derailing legislative proceedings with a bullhorn to demand gun control.

Next week President Biden will roll out the White House red carpet for Messrs. Jones and Pearson, along with Rep. Gloria Johnson, who participated in the disruption to a lesser extent, and who was narrowly spared expulsion.

Press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre claimed at a Wednesday briefing that the three state lawmakers were punished ¡°for peacefully protesting in support of stronger gun-safety laws.¡± She added that Mr. Biden phoned them and ¡°thanked them for their leadership,¡± as well as for defending ¡°democratic values.¡±

The response from Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is even more unbelievable. Last week Mr. Schumer and four other Democratic Senators sent a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland, asking him to investigate whether the Tennessee House violated the U.S. Constitution or federal law. These Democrats also go far beyond protesting the expulsions. They argue that the ruckus caused by Messrs. Jones and Pearson was following in the tradition of the civil-rights movement.

¡°By courageously participating in nonviolent demonstrations, they challenged procedural rules governing decorum and good behavior,¡± the Senators write. ¡°We believe the repeated and preventable slaughter of our children should frustrate and disrupt decorum because this horrifying pattern must never be accepted as business as usual.¡±

Think about it: The Majority Leader of the U.S. Senate is publicly arguing that if partisans feel passionately enough about a policy issue, they are justified in disrupting legislative proceedings by force. Wait until GOP Sen. Josh Hawley hears this news. Would Mr. Schumer be so blas? if a trio of Republican Senators with a bullhorn hijacked his daily agenda to protest abortion or another policy they consider immoral?

By expelling Messrs. Jones and Pearson, the Tennessee House made them into folk heroes on the left. Both were quickly reappointed to their seats on an interim basis. Special elections are being called to fill the seats permanently, and Messrs. Jones and Pearson might well resoundingly win the races to replace themselves. This possibility should have given pause to Tennessee Republicans when they considered the expulsions in the first place.

Having won the media battle, Democrats now want to twist the event into a case of phony martyrdom. Democrats have spent years presenting themselves as democracy¡¯s last defense. But when two of their own grab a bullhorn and bring the people¡¯s business to a halt, suddenly it¡¯s heroic, if the cause is right. The problem is, someone will always believe the cause is right.",WSJ

https://www.wsj.com/articles/nashville-covenant-christian-school-shooting-police-rex-engelbert-michael-collazo-a26308b0?mod=Searchresults_pos7&page=2,2023-03-29,Opinion | The Heroes of the Nashville School Shooting,"Monday¡¯s murder of six people, including three 9-year-olds, by a deranged attacker at a Christian primary school in Nashville is another sign of mental illness unleashed. Many on the left and right barely paused in horror before renewing the nation¡¯s culture wars on gun control and now transgender politics, not that any insight has been the result.

The heroes in Nashville were the police, who were on the scene quickly. With great discipline and courage, they entered the building, ran toward the shots, and killed the attacker once she was cornered. Two have been identified as Officer Rex Engelbert and Officer Michael Collazo. A timeline posted by the Tennesseean says the attacker entered the elementary school at 10:11 a.m., shooting out the glass doors. A call to police came at 10:13.

By 10:23, officers were inside the school. They shot the attacker at 10:25. Metropolitan Nashville Police Chief John Drake told reporters that ¡°someone took control and said, ¡®Let¡¯s go, let¡¯s go.¡¯¡± The department has released body camera footage that is harrowing.

Waiting to confront the attacker was the mistake last year in Uvalde, Texas. Nineteen children and two teachers were killed. ¡°Three minutes after the subject entered,¡± the director of the Texas Department of Public Safety later testified, ¡°there was a sufficient number of armed officers wearing body armor to isolate, distract and neutralize the subject.¡±

Officer Engelbert is a four-year veteran of the Nashville department. Officer Collazo has nine years under his belt. News reports say that neither had been in this kind of situation before. Few cops have.

But this is what police officers all across America know is a possibility every morning as they put on that uniform and kiss goodbye to their wives, husbands and children. Going to work is an act of courage for those who spend a career without seeing an active shooter. For all the political focus on bad or abusive cops, most are good men and women who face potential danger to protect the rest of us.

On the left, the pat answer is always stronger gun control. President Biden has called again for Congress to ban ¡°assault weapons.¡± The Nashville shooter allegedly had an AR-15-style rifle, but that¡¯s also one of the nation¡¯s most commonly owned guns.

¡°About 1 in 20 U.S. adults?or roughly 16 million people?own at least one AR-15,¡± the Washington Post says, and Americans use them for everything from hunting to home defense. The Nashville attacker could as easily have used another rifle or a handgun instead.

The shooter was being treated for an emotional disorder, and perhaps Tennessee could consider a ¡°red flag¡± law in such situations. ¡°Her parents felt like that she should not own weapons,¡± Chief Drake said. But she hid the guns. After selling one firearm, they were under the impression ¡°she did not own any more.¡±

We¡¯ll no doubt learn more soon about her mental health and possible motive, including her history as a transgender former student of the Christian school. But there is nothing but madness in murdering 9-year-olds.",WSJ
https://www.wsj.com/articles/gop-presidential-hopefuls-pledge-support-for-gun-rights-at-nra-convention-bd8de2e6?mod=Searchresults_pos8&page=2,2023-04-14,GOP Presidential Hopefuls Pledge Support for Gun Rights at NRA Convention,"Republicans have resisted Democrats¡¯ calls for new restrictions after mass shootings in Nashville and Louisville

Current and likely 2024 Republican presidential hopefuls reiterated support for gun rights and looser restrictions at the annual National Rifle Association convention in Indianapolis, rejecting Democratic calls to ban assault-style weapons and high-capacity magazines in the wake of mass shootings in Nashville and Louisville.

¡°This is not a gun problem, this is a mental-health problem, this is a social problem, this is a cultural problem, this a spiritual problem,¡± said former President Donald Trump, the current GOP front-runner for 2024. 

He proposed allowing concealed weapons to be carried across state lines, said he would stop ¡°bullying¡± of gun shop owners and seek tax incentives to arm teachers. He also pledged again to make public a list of names from which he would pick Supreme Court nominees, if elected.

¡°They want to take away your guns while throwing open the jailhouse doors and releasing bloodthirsty criminals into your communities,¡± Mr. Trump said of Democrats, vowing to be ¡°your loyal friend and fearless champion once again.¡±

Democrats have said Mr. Trump and fellow Republicans have missed the chance to reduce gun violence by not supporting restrictions.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, Mr. Trump¡¯s closest rival for the GOP nomination, appeared by video as he continues to make appearances across the country ahead of an expected presidential bid. He highlighted signing a bill earlier this month allowing people to carry concealed guns without a permit.

¡°I¡¯ve resisted calls to take up gun control, even when such a stand is superficially unpopular, because I understand that it is precisely at those moments when a right is unpopular that it needs true champions,¡± he said.

Former Vice President Mike Pence, who is also mounting a campaign, called for changing federal death-penalty laws to bring quicker executions of those who engage in mass shootings. ¡°We don¡¯t need gun control, we need crime control,¡± he said after expressing sorrow over the shootings. 

¡°To Joe Biden and the gun-control extremists, give up on your pipe dreams of gun confiscation,¡± Mr. Pence added. ¡°Stop endangering our lives with gun bans.¡±

The NRA gathering followed the March 27 shooting at a private Christian school in Nashville that left six dead, including three children. Last week, a gunman killed five people and wounded eight others at a bank in Louisville.

In response, President Biden again called on Congress to ban assault-style weapons. But lawmakers quickly tamped down already low expectations for any new legislation. 

While some Republicans have supported some restrictions in recent years, powerful groups such as the NRA have lobbied against such steps. And GOP presidential hopefuls are taking an uncompromising approach as they compete for conservative support. Instead of new gun laws, speakers Friday called for tougher law enforcement, more police in schools and funding for mental-health treatment.

Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who has officially entered the race, said that she is a concealed-weapons permit holder and that her husband is a hunter. ¡°So know that you¡¯ve always got a friend in me, you¡¯ve always got a partner in me as they try and take away any of our constitutional rights,¡± she said.

The White House criticized the NRA gathering and pointed to research showing that more children and teens were killed by guns in 2021 than any year since 1999. Nearly half of parents fear their children getting shot, according to Pew Research Center. ¡°President Biden believes our children and educators deserve to learn and teach in safety, and we need common sense gun safety laws to keep dangerous guns out of dangerous hands,¡± read a White House statement.

A ban on assault-style weapons doesn¡¯t have enough support to overcome the Senate¡¯s 60-vote threshold to advance most legislation, much less pass the Republican-led House. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) has said he passionately supports a ban, but he hasn¡¯t committed to bringing such a bill to the floor. 

¡°I¡¯ve been frustrated for many years here in the Senate, we don¡¯t vote on issues. To me, an assault-weapon ban is common sense,¡± Sen. Ben Cardin (D., Md.) said recently.

Still, Mr. Cardin said he wouldn¡¯t fault Mr. Schumer if he decided not to force vulnerable Democratic senators to vote on a bill that had little to no chance of becoming law. ¡°I don¡¯t think we have to have a show vote,¡± he said.

After the Nashville shooting, Sen. John Cornyn (R., Texas) said calls for an assault-weapons ban were neither realistic nor productive. ¡°There seems to be an obsession with the gun, and not with the actual person pulling the trigger, which is where I suggest the focus should be,¡± he said.

Mr. Cornyn, a close ally of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.), led a successful push last year to pass bipartisan gun-safety legislation after the Uvalde elementary-school shooting in his home state. 

That bill provided roughly $15 billion in funding to help states put in place and enforce extreme protection orders, known as red-flag laws, that remove guns from people deemed dangerous. It also closed the so-called boyfriend loophole, which allowed convicted domestic abusers to buy guns if they aren¡¯t married to their partners, and expanded background checks to include juvenile and mental-health records for buyers under 21 years old. The legislation included funding to address mental-health issues and upgrade school safety. 

The bipartisan group that negotiated that bill didn¡¯t seriously discuss a assault-weapons ban or high-capacity magazines.

In Tennessee, Republicans are facing pressure to act and some have shown a willingness toward more school security and red-flag laws. Those laws have spread to some states but have divided the GOP and drawn opposition from the NRA.",WSJ

Here is a look at what divided government means for key issues.
Taxes

The end of unified Democratic government will prevent Mr. Biden from following through on key 2020 campaign goals, including raising tax rates on corporations and high-income households.

    After pushing significant tax laws through the current Congress, other Biden administration priorities, including new taxes on the wealthiest Americans¡¯ unrealized capital gains, will be dead in a divided government. Meanwhile, Mr. Biden¡¯s veto will prevent Republicans from repealing tax laws he signed. Republicans will conduct Internal Revenue Service oversight hearings and pursue restrictions on how the agency uses its new money.
    Some tax legislation is still possible, thanks to bipartisan momentum for expanding tax breaks for retirement savings. There could be a deal to extend expired tax breaks and prevent some business-tax increases scheduled to take effect under a law passed in 2017.
    Key provisions of the 2017 tax law?lower individual tax rates, a higher standard deduction and a 20% deduction for closely held businesses?are scheduled to expire after 2025. GOP lawmakers see the tax cuts as a success in spurring economic growth and say taxpayers deserve the certainty of knowing they will continue. Democrats say the cuts were too tilted toward high-income households. While the dispute probably won¡¯t be resolved soon, lawmakers are likely to argue about it ahead of the 2024 election.

Richard Rubin
Markets

The nation¡¯s borrowing limit and financial regulation will be closely watched issues on Wall Street in the next two years.

Some GOP lawmakers have signaled a willingness to use negotiations over raising or suspending the nation¡¯s debt limit as a way to demand spending cuts. Those dynamics set up the potential for a high-stakes partisan conflict during the negotiations, which could come in the second half of 2023.

    Once the debt limit of roughly $31.4 trillion is reached and the Treasury Department exhausts emergency measures, lawmakers would need to raise the limit or else the government would be forced to delay or suspend payments on its obligations, potentially causing a default on bond payments. Such a scenario would likely rattle financial markets and the U.S. economy, which faces heightened risk of recession.
    Bank regulators in Washington, including at the Federal Reserve, are contemplating more stringent merger restrictions for big regional banks, regulatory requirements for large banks to build bigger financial buffers and revamped standards for lending in lower-income communities. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau faces a legal challenge to the constitutionality of its funding that could reach the Supreme Court.
    The Securities and Exchange Commission is pushing to implement an overhaul to the stock market¡¯s plumbing. Also on the agency¡¯s agenda are rules related to climate change and increased transparency requirements for hedge funds and private equity.

Amara Omeokwe
Inflation

The return of divided government means little when it comes to how Washington is likely to address high inflation because lawmakers in both parties largely agree that the Fed is responsible for taking action that will restrain demand to reduce high prices.

    Even before losing control of the House, the White House had largely run out of room to push for higher spending because of resistance in the evenly divided Senate from Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.), who argued that more spending would fuel higher inflation. Mr. Biden in August used executive authority to approve an estimated $400 billion in student-loan forgiveness that economists have said could contribute to higher inflation.
    Republicans could seek to force spending curbs, as they did after taking control of Congress during the first term of the Obama administration. The Fed¡¯s aggressive rate increases this year are likely to slow economic growth next year faster than any fiscal policy might achieve.
    While some Democratic lawmakers have called on the central bank to slow down or pause its rate increases, there is little ability for Congress to influence the Fed directly. Mr. Biden this year appointed three new governors to the Fed¡¯s seven-member board, which has no vacancies. The term of one of those new governors, Lisa Cook, expires in January 2024, and Mr. Biden would need to secure Senate support to reappoint Ms. Cook or nominate someone else to a full 14-year term.

Nick Timiraos
Foreign policy

The war in Ukraine and competition with China are expected to dominate both parties¡¯ foreign-policy agendas for the next two years. Republicans are likely to use their new platform to question U.S. spending on foreign conflicts and investigate the Biden administration¡¯s decision-making on the global stage.

    Support in Congress for pumping aid to Ukraine is starting to fracture as many Republicans in the House question whether the money would be better spent combating China and tackling economic problems facing the U.S., lawmakers and congressional staff from both parties have said. Polls show Republican voters are increasingly opposed to helping Ukraine. Calls to dial back the assistance are likely to continue.
    Competition with China continues to be a theme that both Democrats and Republicans stress as a core national-security priority. Republicans could push for more confrontational policies by bolstering U.S.-Taiwan relations and for more trade barriers. They might try to draw parallels between job losses in the U.S. and competition from China ahead of the 2024 election.
    The Biden administration¡¯s tumultuous and deadly withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021 could be the focus of new investigations. Republicans have accused the administration of failing to act fast enough to evacuate U.S. personnel and Afghan partners. Mr. Biden has defended his administration¡¯s evacuation efforts and said he didn¡¯t want to continue what he has criticized as a ¡°forever war.¡±

Vivian Salama
Abortion

Divided government means bipartisan clashes over abortion and contraception access are likely to continue. Federal legislative change is unlikely, as state lawmakers move to either codify abortion access or further restrict it.

    GOP lawmakers will continue to block efforts by Democrats to ensure that abortion is legal throughout the U.S. Such efforts, passed twice in the House, have failed to garner sufficient Senate support.
    Senate Democrats and Mr. Biden will likely be able to block any Republican push for a broader national ban. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) has proposed banning abortions after 15 weeks nationwide, with some exemptions, though some in his party said the issue should be left to states. The Republican Study Committee, the most influential conservative caucus in the House, has backed legislation from Rep. Mike Kelly (R., Pa.) that would ban abortions after the detection of a fetal heartbeat.
    Republicans could seek to block other administration efforts such as a federal fund that Mr. Biden supports for women who need to take time off work or find child care as they prepare to have an abortion, and they are likely to try to block abortion providers such as Planned Parenthood Federation of America from getting federal family-planning grants.

Stephanie Armour
Healthcare

Democrats and Republicans are gearing up for fights over entitlement programs such as Medicare and a drug-pricing provision passed in 2022. Major legislation is unlikely, but Republicans could seek to attach some changes to must-pass bills to force Democrats to negotiate.

    House Republicans have proposed raising the Medicare eligibility age and adding means-testing. Mr. Biden has said he would block any cuts to entitlement programs.
    Republicans are expected to investigate the administration¡¯s Covid-19 response, how pandemic relief funds have been deployed and the origins of the virus.
    Gridlock in Congress will likely mean more health-policy actions will occur at the state level. Nevada lawmakers are moving ahead with a state public health insurance option that is set to launch in 2026, joining Colorado and Washington state.

Stephanie Armour
Energy and climate

Divided government could slow the pace of climate-focused initiatives that Mr. Biden has rolled out since entering the White House. Republicans are expected to dial up pressure on the Biden administration to look more favorably on fossil fuels and try to increase domestic oil-and-gas production in response to Russia¡¯s invasion of Ukraine.

    Mr. Biden and Democrats in Congress have tried to curb greenhouse-gas emissions and meet global climate goals by passing a $1 trillion infrastructure plan with measures to help communities endure extreme weather and a separate $370 billion of climate-focused provisions, mostly in the form of tax breaks for major wind and solar project developers. Republicans are unlikely to back more spending on climate initiatives and plan to push for more development of American energy sources.
    Republicans and Democrats could work together on changing the laws that govern the U.S. permitting process for major infrastructure projects. Republicans say speeding up new oil-and-gas production would eventually bring down energy prices for consumers. Democrats who support the permitting changes say they would ease the path for new renewable-energy projects. Permitting changes were blocked in the last Congress in the midst of opposition from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, but they are likely to come up again.
    Republicans could launch investigations and hold hearings to slow down new regulations. More stringent requirements from the Biden administration for vehicle tailpipe emissions haven¡¯t taken effect, for example. Republicans could also push for budget cuts for federal agencies that are charged with implementing environmental regulations.

Katy Stech Ferek
Gun control

Mr. Biden has repeatedly called on Congress to pass major gun-control measures such as reinstating the federal ban on certain semiautomatic weapons, but such efforts have stalled even with Democratic majorities in both chambers. Congress passed a modest bipartisan gun package after the Uvalde, Texas, massacre, which included funding for states to implement and enforce red-flag laws to remove guns from people deemed dangerous; expanding background checks for gun buyers under 21 to include juvenile records; and tougher sentences for gun traffickers.

    Divided government likely snuffs out Mr. Biden¡¯s hopes of passing significant gun-control measures in Congress. No major gun-control bills have ever passed with a Republican-led House.
    The GOP will have trouble advancing a gun-rights agenda with a Democrat in the White House. Only under Republican presidents have major pro-gun laws been enacted, such as the 2005 law signed by George W. Bush that limited liability for gun manufacturers when their weapons are used in crimes.
    Mr. Biden could advance gun-control measures through executive orders, as he did in ordering the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to craft new restrictions on homemade firearm kits.

Zusha Elinson
Investigations

Republicans plan to initiate an aggressive series of investigations aimed at Mr. Biden and his administration. House Republicans spent much of the past year issuing document-preservation requests to various departments to lay the groundwork for the probes.

    Republicans expect to focus on Mr. Biden and his family. At least one likely committee chairman has said he wants to determine whether the business dealings of Mr. Biden¡¯s son Hunter Biden compromise national security. Both Bidens have denied wrongdoing. The Wall Street Journal, reporting on Hunter Biden¡¯s business dealings, didn¡¯t find President Biden to have been involved in his son¡¯s efforts.
    Republicans are likely to dig into the Justice Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Some in the GOP say the Justice Department has become politicized. Among other things, Republicans were infuriated when Attorney General Merrick Garland authorized the application for a warrant to seize records with more than 700 pages of classified material that former President Donald Trump took to his Florida home. Mr. Garland has said that he is focused on upholding the rule of law fairly.
    House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.), who will become speaker if his party stays united behind him, has been weighing whether to continue the select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol. The committee is supposed to dissolve 30 days after the issuance of a final report, which is slated to be released soon. Reinstating the panel would allow Republicans to reframe the probe, but it would also keep the issue in the spotlight.

The Supreme Court said Friday it would decide whether people subject to domestic-violence protective orders have a Second Amendment right to be armed.

The new consideration of gun rights gives the court an opportunity to say more about the scope of the Second Amendment a year after it issued a blockbuster ruling that expanded gun rights and adopted a new legal approach that bases the constitutionality of weapons regulations on whether similar laws existed early in the nation¡¯s history. 

The case is one of a half-dozen the justices added to their docket before their summer break. The court will hear the cases in its next term that begins in October.

In the gun case, the Biden administration is appealing a ruling that threw out the conviction of an Arlington, Texas, man, Zackey Rahimi, for possessing firearms while under a domestic-violence restraining order. A federal law enacted in 1994 disarmed individuals whom courts have ordered to stop threatening an intimate partner after finding they pose a credible threat. Over the past year, lower courts, attempting to apply the Supreme Court¡¯s guidance in its 2022 decision, New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen, have issued conflicting rulings on whether the 1994 law is constitutional.

Police in 2021 executed a warrant to search Rahimi¡¯s home after suspecting his involvement in more than one shooting, finding a pistol, a rifle and ammunition, along with a copy of the restraining order against him. His ex-girlfriend obtained the two-year protection order in February 2020, alleging in an affidavit that Rahimi physically abused her, threatened to kill her while brandishing a gun and fired a gun at her vehicle while she tried to flee him. The order restrained him from harassing, stalking or threatening his ex-girlfriend and their child.

In February, a three-judge panel of the New Orleans-based Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the domestic-abuser law violated the Second Amendment. The defendant, ¡°while hardly a model citizen, is nonetheless among ¡®the people¡¯ entitled to the Second Amendment¡¯s guarantees,¡± Judge Cory T. Wilson, who was appointed by former President Donald Trump, wrote in the ruling.

The Rahimi case could clarify when misconduct or dangerousness strips a citizen of Second Amendment rights.

The appeals court relied on Bruen¡¯s holding that lower courts should judge the constitutionality of gun-control measures based on their similarity to historical firearm regulation from the country¡¯s early years in the late 1700s and 1800s. 

That high court ruling, which struck down New York¡¯s century-old concealed handgun permitting requirements, reinvigorated challenges to federal gun-control provisions that make it illegal for certain classes of people to possess firearms.

In Rahimi¡¯s case, the Fifth Circuit panel concluded the domestic-abuse gun law didn¡¯t have adequate historical support.

In March, a California federal judge ??declared the same statute constitutional. Judges have also clashed on whether gun rights should be extended to marijuana users, people convicted of nonviolent crimes and defendants under felony indictment.

The Justice Department moved swiftly to get the Rahimi ruling before the Supreme Court. U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar in the government¡¯s appeal said the Fifth Circuit had ¡°overlooked the strong historical evidence supporting the general principle that the government may disarm dangerous individuals.¡±

The federal law under which Rahimi had been convicted addresses ¡°a profound threat to public safety that was ignored or minimized for too much of our Nation¡¯s history,¡± she wrote, warning that striking it down would threaten ¡°grave consequences for the safety of victims of domestic violence, law-enforcement officers and the public.¡± 

Most states have their own laws that make it a crime to possess firearms while under a domestic-violence restraining order, many of which require people placed under orders to relinquish their guns.

Rahimi faces state charges including aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, and he remains in custody, according to Tarrant County records. A felony conviction on the state charges would also disqualify him from gun ownership.",WSJ

NASHVILLE?Tennessee Republican leaders said they would act following a mass shooting at a private Christian school that left six dead as pressure mounted from churches, civic groups and Democrats urging action.

After days of mourning, officials from both parties and residents here have said they hope their hometown tragedy sparks some sort of change. Major protests have taken place at the state Capitol. Democrats have suggested tightening laws to make it harder for people who are a danger to themselves or others to buy guns.

Lt. Gov. Randy McNally sent a letter to Republican Gov. Bill Lee on Wednesday, calling for armed guards at all schools, securing windows and glass doors in schools, magnetic locks on doors and other measures. He also told reporters that he would support red-flag laws, given ¡°adequate protection¡± against false reporting, although he was unsure the rest of Republican leadership agreed.

Mr. Lee, who has made no public appearances since the Monday morning shooting, released a brief, recorded statement on social media Tuesday evening. ¡°We will act to prevent this from happening again,¡± he said, without mentioning specifics.

¡°I understand the desperation to have answers, to place blame, to argue about a solution that could prevent this horrible tragedy¡¦but this is not a time for hate or rage,¡± he said.

A spokeswoman for Mr. Lee said the governor has long been focused on school safety, including backing legislation to aid schools seeking to strengthen security. ¡°The Governor and our office have had extensive conversations with members of the General Assembly for months?certainly this week included,¡± she wrote in an email to The Wall Street Journal.

Audrey Hale, the 28-year-old suspect, on Monday attacked the Covenant School in the wealthy Green Hills neighborhood, according to police. Hale was a local illustrator who once attended the school. On Monday, the suspect used a semiautomatic rifle to shoot the school¡¯s glass doors, then went inside killing three students and three adults. Police confronted Hale on the second floor and opened fire, a dramatic scene captured on video from police officer body cameras.

Police identified the victims as Evelyn Dieckhaus, William Kinney and Hallie Scruggs, daughter of the Covenant Presbyterian Church¡¯s lead pastor, all age 9. Also killed were Cynthia ¡°Cindy¡± Peak, 61, a substitute teacher; Katherine Koonce, 60, the head of school; and Mike Hill, 61, a custodian at the school, according to police.

On Thursday, city officials released 911 calls received during the shooting. On one call, a woman in the school whispered into the phone ¡°please hurry¡± and told the dispatcher she heard gunshots. On another, a caller described seeing a man shooting out the glass doors with what the caller described as ¡°an assault rifle¡± and entering the school. Hale, a former student of the school, had recently begun identifying as a transgender man, according to police. 

Police haven¡¯t released a detailed explanation of a motive in the shooting or writings they say that Hale left behind. 

The Covenant School is a prestigious private school in Nashville, and many of Tennessee¡¯s powerful have direct or indirect ties to the school. In his video, Mr. Lee said one of the victims, Ms. Peak, was a close friend of his wife. 

Anna Caudill, a Nashville special-education advocate and close friend of another victim, Ms. Koonce, said she voted for Mr. Lee but was disappointed in his public response so far. She said she wanted the governor and state leaders to take swift action and would support a red-flag law, which would allow authorities to take away guns from people that a court deems dangerous.

¡°I appreciate that Bill¡¯s language was noninflammatory,¡± she said of his video. ¡°However, anything he says is political because he leads the state in his capacity as governor. He¡¯s not our pastor. He is our governor.¡±

The Republican supermajorities in the Tennessee legislature have given priority to expanded gun access in recent years. A 2021 law made ownership permits optional for handguns. In recent weeks, Republican lawmakers had pushed bills to drop the age limit for carrying a handgun without a permit to 18 from 21 and to expand permitless open carry to include long guns. On Tuesday, GOP leaders delayed discussion on those bills for at least a week. 

Republicans here have worked to expand gun rights in the state in recent years, and Mr. Lee has welcomed gun makers to relocate to the state. On Thursday, protesters gathered at the state Capitol in downtown Nashville to urge the legislature to pass gun-control measures, briefly disrupting some legislative proceedings.

A spokesman for House Speaker Cameron Sexton didn¡¯t respond to requests seeking comment.

Beyond the state capitol, the state¡¯s active and powerful religious community called for government leaders to work to reduce the chances of a future mass shooting.

Josh Graves, pastor of the large Otter Creek Church based in Brentwood, Tenn., called for ¡°intentional, systemic response¡± to gun violence. The church¡¯s Nashville campus isn¡¯t far from the neighborhood where the shooting took place. 

¡°There are no simple solutions and this is not a partisan matter. This is a uniquely American problem and we need courageous and creative leaders in all spheres of life to help us move forward as a society. Our prayers are noble, but they are not enough,¡± Mr. Graves wrote in an email to congregants late Tuesday evening. 

Other faith communities are watching the shooting investigation and the legislative response closely. 

¡°We embrace the idea that kids should be safe when they go to school,¡± said Rick Musacchio, executive director of the Tennessee Catholic Conference. The Diocese of Nashville regularly reevaluates security at its schools, Mr. Musacchio said.

Democratic state Sen. Heidi Campbell, whose district includes the area where the shooting occurred, said she expected Mr. Lee and the Republican leadership to focus efforts on security around schools but not gun measures. 

Ms. Campbell and other Democrats plan to renew efforts to propose gun-control measures they have pushed in the past, such as a red-flag law. The Tennessee General Assembly is a part-time legislature, and this year¡¯s session is almost up, so they likely won¡¯t propose such legislation until the 2024 session, she said. 

She said that since Monday¡¯s shooting, she had noticed ¡°a little bit of give, but no promises¡± from Republican counterparts.

The Tennessee Firearms Association, a gun-rights advocacy group, declined to comment for this article. But the day after the shooting, the association posted on its website a blog item about Mr. Lee¡¯s record regarding guns. The post included a copy of Mr. Lee¡¯s answers to candidate questions from the association in 2018. The association highlighted Mr. Lee¡¯s support for ¡°arming schoolteachers to aid in defense of our schools.¡±  

Hundreds attended a citywide vigil Wednesday evening at Nashville¡¯s Public Square Park. Dr. Jill Biden, the first lady, joined city leaders and other representatives of Tennessee on the steps of the historic courthouse, but didn¡¯t speak during the brief event.

In attendance were survivors of the 2018 shooting at a Nashville Waffle House restaurant, which had been the city¡¯s most deadly mass shooting. A shooter killed four and left others injured. 

Abede DaSilva, whose brother was killed in front of him during that shooting, said Wednesday he came to lend support to victims¡¯ families. He and his mother, Shaundelle Brooks, have spent years lobbying for state gun-control measures. Asked whether they expected this tragedy to result in change, Ms. Brooks paused. 

¡°We¡¯re hoping,¡± she said, adding: ¡°We¡¯ve been preaching and asking and begging and pleading for so long, and here we are, another mass shooting, so I don¡¯t know.¡±",WSJ

Sen. Phil Gramm is right that compromise is key to getting things done in Washington and in most of life, for that matter (¡°The Reagan Revolution Was Built on Compromise,¡± op-ed, Feb. 23). Compromise requires two parties working in good faith. Unfortunately, that¡¯s not how things are going in Congress right now.

I¡¯ve often said that compromise in Washington means everyone gets what they want, so no one has to make a hard choice. But over the past two years, we¡¯ve seen a different kind of compromise, where one side gets what it wants and the other side gets nothing. It isn¡¯t compromise at all, actually, it¡¯s caving in, and Senate Republican leadership has grossly embraced it as a new norm.

I don¡¯t endorse a my-way-or-the-highway approach. But all this caving in makes me mad because it betrays everything Republicans commit to when we ask voters to send us to Congress to get things done for them.

I bet none of my GOP colleagues campaigned on new gun-control legislation, a reckless $1.7 trillion omnibus bill or raising the debt ceiling without securing any spending reforms. But that¡¯s what Senate Republican leadership gave Democrats last Congress. Big wins for President Biden and Sen. Chuck Schumer, but less freedom and higher inflation for the rest of us.

To make Washington work, we need compromise. But it¡¯s time for Republicans to stand up and make Democrats compromise, too.",WSJ
https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-the-nations-gun-laws-are-in-chaos-587ded3f?mod=Searchresults_pos15&page=2,2023-08-01,Why America¡¯s Gun Laws Are in Chaos,"The Supreme Court last summer sought to clarify its expansive reading of the Second Amendment. Instead, it set off chaos.

The decision in New York State Rifle and Pistol Association v. Bruen decreed that gun-control laws of today must have a clear forerunner in weapons regulations around the time of the nation¡¯s infancy, regardless of the modern public-safety rationale behind them.

The result: Hundreds of gun cases litigated in recent months have become a free-for-all, with lower courts conflicted or confounded about how and where to draw limits on gun rights.

¡°There¡¯s all this picking and choosing of historical evidence. ¡®This is too early. This is too late. Too small, too big,¡¯¡± Judge Gerard Lynch of the Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said during a recent argument about a new law in New York that prohibits guns in sensitive places like parks, museums and bars. ¡°The whole thing puzzles me.¡±

In that case, the right of licensed handgun owners to carry weapons into bars and theaters could hinge on 19th-century statutes that barred drunks from carrying firearms, and outlawed guns and butcher knives in social parties attended by ladies. A case decided last fall held that the federal ban on guns with obliterated serial numbers was unconstitutional because unmarked guns were perfectly legal in the 18th century. 

The Bruen case launched the upheaval. In that decision, the Supreme Court said New York couldn¡¯t require concealed-carry applicants to prove a dire need for self-protection. The 6-3 opinion, written by Justice Clarence Thomas and endorsed by five fellow conservatives, said the restrictive licensing rules violated the Second Amendment right of ordinary, law-abiding citizens to carry handguns for self-defense.

The opinion rejected the practice of lower courts considering the public-safety intentions of gun laws being challenged. The courts often found that the government¡¯s goal of curbing gun crimes and mass shootings outweighed the liberty interests of gun owners.

That practice watered down gun rights, the opinion said. Instead, Thomas wrote, to pass constitutional muster, gun restrictions within the scope of the Second Amendment must be deeply rooted in historical precedent. Governments defending them bear the burden of showing that their laws are similar, or at least analogous, to firearm regulations widely enforced around the time of Second Amendment¡¯s ratification in 1791.

The decision, along with recent Supreme Court cases overturning abortion rights and protecting religious expression in the public sphere, reflects the conservative majority¡¯s emphasis on history and tradition as the arbiter of constitutional conflicts. 

Judges often engage in historical inquiries to interpret constitutional text and figure out the scope of protected rights and governmental powers. But in Bruen, never before had the high court demanded such a rigid reliance on historical evidence to settle questions about a core constitutional right. 

¡°What I don¡¯t think I¡¯ve ever seen elsewhere is a demand by the court that every single difficult case be resolved by a historical record that contains so little information,¡± said Nelson Lund, a George Mason University legal scholar who has written critically of the Bruen decision. 
Rampant disagreement

The Bruen decision was a sequel to the late Justice Antonin Scalia¡¯s 2008 opinion in District of Columbia v. Heller that first held that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to keep and bear arms for self-defense, not just the right of states to form militias. The 5-4 Heller decision was a defining moment for originalism, the judicial philosophy championed by Scalia that says judges should interpret constitutional provisions according to their meaning at the time they were adopted.

The Bruen decision extended Heller¡¯s understanding of the Second Amendment¡¯s text with the added constraint of the historical test.

Judges are at odds about how to use centuries-old weapons laws, many obscure, to evaluate modern-day restrictions and firearm offenses.

Some courts upholding the federal gun ban on pot users say the law is consistent with the tradition of keeping guns away from the mentally ill or unvirtuous citizens. Other courts declared the ban unconstitutional, citing a dearth of evidence that 18th- and 19th-century Americans who consumed intoxicating substances forfeited their gun rights.

A similar split has emerged over whether the government can disarm individuals subject to domestic-violence protection orders. A New Orleans-based federal appeals court said no, finding no parallel treatment of abusive spouses in early-American codes. Weeks later, a federal judge in California concluded the opposite, drawing on 19th-century statutes requiring individuals deemed a threat to public safety to post bonds before carrying weapons in public. The Supreme Court will take up the issue in its next term, which begins in October.

In 1791, when the Second Amendment was ratified along with the rest of the Bill of Rights, the nation was a preindustrial, largely agrarian society. Americans armed themselves with single-shot flintlocks whose cumbersome reloading and inaccuracy beyond a short range made them far less deadly than today¡¯s semiautomatic firearms. 

Founding-era weapons laws, a complete list of which is still being assembled by academic researchers, were concerned with gunpowder storage, preventing accidents and keeping guns away from slaves, Native Americans and British loyalists.

Thomas¡¯s opinion in the Bruen decision also suggested that laws in existence around 1868?when the 14th Amendment was ratified to protect federal rights from infringement by state governments?could serve as a historical baseline.

¡°This Court is not a trained historian,¡± U.S. District Judge Carlton Reeves of Mississippi wrote in an order last fall. ¡°We are not experts in what white, wealthy, and male property owners thought about firearms regulation in 1791. Yet we are now expected to play historian in the name of constitutional adjudication.¡± He floated the idea of appointing a historian as a consulting expert to assist him. 

The Bruen case has placed a wide range of federal and state gun regulations in jeopardy. In the past year, judges have ruled against bans on AR-15 assault rifles, laws restricting adults under 21 from purchasing or carrying handguns in public and other gun-control measures found to be lacking in historical tradition.

Courts have also slashed away at the federal Gun Control Act, originated in 1968, the once-presumed-untouchable law that makes it illegal for certain classes of people to possess firearms, including domestic abusers, drug users and those under felony indictment.

U.S. District Judge Robert L. Miller last fall dismissed charges against a man who attempted to buy a gun from an Indiana pawnshop while under indictment. Though the government had been restricting firearm use by people under indictment since as far back as 1938, the judge said, that didn¡¯t prove a historical tradition under Bruen. 

In the decision¡¯s concluding paragraphs, Miller said he earnestly hoped that he had misunderstood the Supreme Court¡¯s new command. ¡°If not, most of the body of law Congress has developed to protect both public safety and the right to bear arms might well be unconstitutional,¡± he wrote.

Historians as witnesses

The case has given firearms historians new roles as key witnesses. California and other pro-gun-control states have assembled a roster of gun historians?compensating some at a rate of $500 an hour?to scavenge databases and newspaper archives for historic gun laws and render their opinion on them.

Days after the Bruen decision, political scientist Robert Spitzer got an email from the California attorney general¡¯s office looking for help in defending the state¡¯s 10-round limit on magazine capacity and restrictions on AR-15s. The professor, a retired academic who authored several books about American gun policy and the history of gun regulations, would be retained by more than 10 other states in the months that followed.

¡°It¡¯s been nearly a full-time occupation for me,¡± Spitzer said. He has dug deep into archaic restrictions on Bowie knives?the folklore-famed combat knife wielded by street brawlers and duelers?and spring guns?tripwire-rigged booby traps also known as trap guns that were once deployed against rabbit thieves and trespassers.

Courts have looked at those old laws as possible analogues to AR-15 crackdowns. California argues laws on spring guns are ¡°particularly analogous¡± to its AR-15 ban in their goal of protecting the public from ¡°unnecessary gunshot injuries.¡±

Gun-rights groups have recruited their own historians. They include Ashley Hlebinsky, a founder of University of Wyoming law school¡¯s new center for gun research and a former curator of one of the largest firearms museums in the country. The groups have also turned to Clayton Cramer, an adjunct community college instructor in Idaho known for exposing errors in another scholar¡¯s work on American gun culture and colonial-era gun ownership.

The dueling teams of historians have clashed in court papers, accusing each other of mischaracterizing past arms regulations. Spitzer and Cramer leveled accusations of shoddy scholarship at each other in a lawsuit challenging Chicago suburb Highland Park¡¯s ban on assault weapons.

In federal court rulings from Delaware, Washington state and Illinois that refused to block assault-weapon bans, judges said the crackdown on semiautomatic rifles resembled 19th-century restrictions on the carrying of Bowie knives. 

¡°The ¡®craze¡¯ for these knives led to their widespread use in fights, duels, and other criminal activities,¡± wrote U.S. District Judge Richard Andrews of Delaware in March. ¡°As violent crime increased during the early nineteenth century, states responded with anti-knife legislation.¡±

In late April, however, a different federal judge in Illinois, U.S. District Judge Stephen McGlynn of East St. Louis, Ill., ruled against the state¡¯s assault-weapons ban, rejecting the comparison to old Bowie laws. The analogy failed, he said, because the Bowie statutes didn¡¯t criminalize possession of the weapon?unlike Illinois¡¯s law?but mostly restricted the carrying of concealed knives in public places. 

Illinois, the judge said, enacted the law months after a gunman shot up an Independence Day parade in Highland Park. ¡°Can the senseless crimes of a relative few be so despicable to justify the infringement of the constitutional rights of law-abiding individuals in hopes that such crimes will then abate or, at least, not be as horrific?¡± wrote Judge McGlynn. ¡°Likely no,¡± he answered. A federal appeals court in Chicago is now reviewing the state law.
Gun rights of felons

A federal appeals court in Philadelphia recently reviewed a federal law disarming people convicted of felonies and serious misdemeanors. It upheld the gun rights of a Pennsylvania man forbidden from arming himself because he once committed food-stamp fraud decades ago. In doing so, the court rejected analogies to early-American state laws confiscating firearms from Blacks, Native Americans, Catholics, Quakers and British loyalists.

Judge Reeves of Mississippi upheld in June the gun rights of a man convicted of aggravated assault and manslaughter, saying he was following the high court¡¯s reasoning in Bruen. But a federal appeals court based in St. Louis affirmed the indictment of a convicted drug dealer for illegal gun possession. The court noted that in the late 1700s nonviolent crimes such as horse theft or forgery were capital offenses?and in such a punishment one loses the right to bear arms. 

The Biden administration hopes the case the Supreme Court will hear in the coming term will result in gun prohibitions being retained on individuals subject to domestic-violence protective orders.

A February appeals court ruling threw out the conviction of an Arlington, Texas, man for possessing firearms while under a domestic-violence restraining order after applying the guidance of the Bruen case. In its decision, the New Orleans-based Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the domestic-abuse gun law lacked historical support.

The court said the man, who also faces charges on multiple shootings, was ¡°hardly a model citizen¡± but said he was still ¡°part of the political community entitled to the Second Amendment¡¯s guarantees.¡±

U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar in the government¡¯s high-court appeal said the Fifth Circuit ¡°missed the forest for the trees¡± and ¡°overlooked the strong historical evidence supporting the general principle that the government may disarm dangerous individuals.¡±

Most of the litigation challenging criminal gun laws is spearheaded by public defenders, not gun-rights groups, on behalf of indigent defendants.

Within 48 hours after the Bruen decision, Lex Coleman, a federal public defender in West Virginia, was on the phone with clients, including Randy Price, an Ohio man caught possessing a pistol with an obliterated serial number in violation of federal law.

Coleman told Price they needed to file motions contesting the constitutionality of the charges against him. ¡°The world has changed, and we need to go for this and see what happens,¡± he said he told Price. 

He got the indictment on that charge overturned after prosecutors struggled to identify a historical statute similar to the prohibition on unmarked guns. ¡°We¡¯re being forced under this decision to look back in time¡¦quite frankly I find it really hard,¡± prosecutor Negar Kordestani told the judge.

In dismissing the gun charge, the judge found it ¡°undisputed that serial numbers were not required, or even in common use, in 1791.¡±",WSJ

Kathy Hochul became the first woman elected to lead the Empire State after she defeated Republican U.S. Rep. Lee Zeldin, according to the Associated Press, in a closer-than-expected race that caught the attention of national Democrats.

While there are twice as many enrolled Democrats in the state as Republicans, polls showed the race tightening in October and Ms. Hochul¡¯s margin of victory was around 5%, according to the state Board of Elections. That marks the best showing by a GOP gubernatorial candidate since George Pataki secured the last Republican statewide win in 2002.

Mr. Zeldin won a majority of the vote on Long Island, where Republicans were also poised to gain seats in the state Senate and U.S. House, according to state and local election boards.

Ms. Hochul, 64 years old, became the state¡¯s first female governor last year after the resignation of Gov. Andrew Cuomo; she was his lieutenant governor. She mentioned the historic nature of her candidacy in a victory speech.

¡°I felt the weight on my shoulders to make sure every little girl and every woman who has banged up against ceilings all her life would know that a woman can be elected in her own right and successfully govern a state as rough and tumble as New York,¡± she said.

Mr. Zeldin conceded the race on Wednesday afternoon. In a statement, he said the election was a ¡°once in a generation campaign, with a very close margin in the bluest of blue states.¡±

Mr. Zeldin, who represents parts of Long Island in the U.S. House, focused on rising crime in New York City and its suburbs. He promised to roll back a 2019 law that eliminated cash bail for most misdemeanor and nonviolent felony offenses, which some law-enforcement officials say has contributed to a rise in crime.

Ms. Hochul campaigned on her record from her year in office, including new gun control laws, Covid-19 pandemic management and rebate checks for taxpayers. She also touted her support for abortion rights and attacked Mr. Zeldin for his ties to former President Donald Trump. Mr. Zeldin voted against certifying President Biden¡¯s victory in the 2020 presidential election.

Mr. Zeldin said he opposes abortion but wouldn¡¯t try to undo state protections.

¡°Zeldin, like a lot of Republicans, got the messaging right for the current climate,¡± Lawrence Levy, executive dean of the National Center for Suburban Studies at Hofstra University on Long Island. ¡°Coming within a few points of Hochul has done a tremendous favor for his party with the damage it caused down-ballot.¡±

Three Democratic state senators on Long Island lost their races, according to the local boards of elections. And Republican candidates won two U.S. House seats held by retiring Democrats Tom Suozzi and Kathleen Rice, according to the Associated Press.

In the last days of the campaign, Mr. Zeldin held rallies with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin?two rising stars within the Republican Party. The Republican Governors Association featured Mr. Zeldin in a donor call and spent more than $2 million to bolster his campaign.

Ms. Hochul, a native of upstate Buffalo, spent the week before polls closed mostly campaigning in New York City. She held rallies with Mr. Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, Bill and Hillary Clinton and Mayor Eric Adams. The Democratic Governors Association opened a super PAC that aired advertisements on her behalf.

David Wilson, a 69-year-old retired teacher, attended a rally with the governor and mayor in Rochdale Village, Queens. He said there was no way he would vote for a Republican after the Trump presidency and said he thought Mr. Zeldin¡¯s position on gun control was wrong. He specifically faulted the candidate¡¯s opposition to a new state law that prohibited firearms in a series of sensitive places, including the subway system.

¡°Open carry in New York? This man is out of his mind,¡± Mr. Wilson said.

A Republican candidate would need to garner at least 30% of the vote in New York City to win statewide, analysts said. The last two GOP challengers to Mr. Cuomo won less than 20% of the vote in the city and Mr. Trump won 23% of the city vote in 2020. Mr. Cuomo resigned last year amid a sexual-harassment scandal.

Mr. Zeldin finished with 30% in New York City, but was still left with a deficit of more than 650,000 votes. He was unable to make up the shortfall on Long Island and in upstate areas where he finished ahead of Ms. Hochul.

The close result should send a message to Ms. Hochul and other Democrats that they should take further action to combat elevated crime, Mr. Pataki said.

Democrats, though, still retain large majorities in both the state Assembly and Senate.

State Sen. Diane Savino, a Democrat from Staten Island who didn¡¯t seek re-election, said Ms. Hochul will be faced with a state Legislature in which there is conflict between the moderate and progressive wings of the Democratic conferences about whether a course correction is needed.

¡°Does she take it as a wake-up call and decide to focus on what the message was that the voters were sending to her?and use her power to respond?¡± Ms. Savino said.

In an interview with WIVB-TV on Wednesday, Ms. Hochul said her margin of victory was due to ¡°national headwinds¡± including high inflation. She said she would continue to work to combat the rising cost of living, improve public safety and develop affordable housing in her next term.

The Republican-led House Judiciary Committee convened a contentious hearing in New York about crime in the city and the policies of Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a forum that was beset by partisan squabbling over the recent indictment of former President Donald Trump.

Rep. Jim Jordan (R., Ohio), the committee¡¯s chairman, started the hearing Monday by blaming Mr. Bragg for crime in New York City. During his campaign for office, Mr. Bragg, a Democrat, advocated for progressive approaches to prosecutions, promoting alternatives to incarceration for some offenders. Arrests for major crimes increased by 22% in 2022 compared with 2021, according to New York Police Department data, though officials said rates have fallen in recent months.

¡°Fairness under the law is a bedrock principle of American democracy,¡± Mr. Jordan said. ¡°Here in Manhattan, the scales of justice are weighed down by politics.¡±

Democratic officials denounced the event as a sham and said it was part of an attempt to smear Mr. Bragg after his office earlier this month charged Donald Trump in connection with a scheme to bolster his 2016 presidential campaign by paying hush money to suppress potentially damaging sexual allegations. Mr. Trump has pleaded not guilty and has denied the sexual allegations.

In a statement, a representative for Mr. Bragg¡¯s office said the hearing was a ¡°political stunt¡± and said the rates of major crime had decreased in the first quarter of 2023 compared with the same period last year. The office noted last week that New York had fewer homicides per capita in 2022 than Columbus, Ohio, near Mr. Jordan¡¯s district.

¡°Ending violence, stopping crime and supporting victims and their families are the most sacred duties of the Manhattan DA¡¯s office,¡± the statement said. ¡°DA Bragg is reducing crime in Manhattan, reversing a tough spike that began before he even took office.¡±

The committee heard testimony from Democratic City Councilmember Robert Holden, the head of the detectives¡¯ union, a gun-control advocate and several people who were crime victims or are related to crime victims.

The hearing lasted roughly four hours and brought another spectacle to lower Manhattan, not far from the courtroom where Mr. Trump was arraigned. People barred from entering the hearing chanted in the hallway of the federal building where it was held. Democratic members on the Judiciary Committee suggested the hearing be moved to Ohio. Many Democrats said the hearing was pointless because federal officials don¡¯t have jurisdiction over local policies.

¡°I¡¯m reminded of the character in ¡®Succession,¡¯ the late Logan Roy, who said, ¡®You are not serious people.¡¯ If you are serious about doing something about violence, gun violence, other violence, please join us,¡± said Rep. Madeleine Dean (D., Pa.).

Rep. Matt Gaetz (R., Fla.) said he didn¡¯t want to insult any New Yorkers because he expected they might soon move to his state of Florida. Republican members said they were lifting up victims and asked them to describe how they felt less safe living in the city.

¡°To the good people of New York, we hear you.¡¦We hope your local leaders will hear from you as well,¡± said Rep. Russell Fry (R., S.C.), who cited a conversation he said he had with a taxi driver who complained about elevated crime.

Democrats pushed for tougher federal gun-control laws, including universal background checks and an assault weapons ban.

Rep. Hank Johnson (D., Ga.) said the witnesses ¡°served as props in a MAGA Broadway production.¡± The comment prompted one of several audience outbursts that led Mr. Jordan to bang the gavel for order. One man, who said he supported Mr. Jordan¡¯s efforts, was later removed from the audience by Mr. Jordan after an outburst.

In March, Mr. Jordan and two other Republican committee chairs requested documents related to the district attorney¡¯s investigation of the former president, saying they needed the information for oversight purposes.

After Mr. Trump was indicted, Mr. Jordan subpoenaed Mark Pomerantz, who resigned from Mr. Bragg¡¯s office last year and published a book this year about his work on the Trump investigation. Mr. Bragg sued Mr. Jordan in federal court to block the subpoena, and a hearing is scheduled for Wednesday. Mr. Pomerantz on Monday said in court papers that he supported Mr. Bragg¡¯s efforts to block the subpoena.

Mr. Bragg said in court papers that the subpoena was a ¡°brazen and unconstitutional attack¡± that illegitimately interfered in Mr. Trump¡¯s case. Mr. Jordan said during a radio interview Monday morning that Congress had broad jurisdiction in its oversight functions.

Since taking office in January of last year, Mr. Bragg has said he would give priority to violent crime, including gun trafficking, but took a more lenient stance on lower-level cases, saying he would instruct prosecutors to avoid seeking jail time. He has also said not all cases involving gun possession merit harsh sentences.

Mayor Eric Adams, speaking at a press conference before the hearing, said neither he nor any member of the NYPD or his administration had been asked to testify. ¡°Let the DA do his job, and that is the job that he¡¯s doing,¡± said Mr. Adams, a Democrat.

Mr. Jordan said during the hearing that the committee would hold additional hearings in other cities. ¡°We¡¯ll go wherever we need to go,¡± he said.",WSJ

Will representative government survive? Yes, somehow we think it will.

Tensions were high at the state capitol last week, amid protests calling for something to be done in response to the recent shooting at an elementary school in Nashville. Reps. Justin Jones and Justin Pearson seized control of the House floor with a bullhorn, demanding action and leading the spectators in the gallery in chants of ¡°Gun control now!¡± and ¡°No action, no peace!¡±

The Tennessean newspaper says they eventually ¡°walked off the House floor after a heated confrontation with their own Democratic leadership,¡± but unchastened, apparently. ¡°There comes a time when you have to do something out of the ordinary,¡± Mr. Jones tweeted soon after. ¡°We occupied the House floor today after repeatedly being silenced from talking about the crisis of mass shootings.¡±

The Tennessee House has an institutional interest in deterring fringe legislators from hijacking the floor to get attention. Democratic debate can get heated, which is why legislative bodies have rules of decorum, such as Congress¡¯s custom of referring to fellow legislators, if through gritted teeth, as ¡°my friend, the gentlewoman from California.¡± Even fake civility has democratic utility.

Expulsion might backfire on the GOP by turning Messrs. Jones and Pearson into martyrs for their cause. They can run for re-election, and meantime Mr. Jones¡¯s seat will be filled by the Nashville Metro Council, some of whose members have already pledged to appoint . . . Mr. Jones. But perhaps he¡¯ll decide that trying to take over the day¡¯s agenda with a bullhorn is more trouble than it¡¯s worth.

National Democrats and media are rushing to associate themselves with this mess, perhaps because they think they can spin it to fit their narrative that Republicans are a mortal threat to democracy.

¡°Today¡¯s expulsion of lawmakers who engaged in peaceful protest,¡± President Biden said, ¡°is shocking, undemocratic, and without precedent.¡± So a democratic body voting to expel unruly members who derail public business is ¡°undemocratic¡±?

With the GOP retaining control of the state House and Senate and the governorship, New Hampshire brings to 39 the number of states with a governing trifecta?one party holding a majority in both legislative chambers while also occupying the governor¡¯s mansion. It is the most trifectas since 1947.

Democrats now hold 17 state trifectas, compared with 22 held by Republicans, after the party flipped legislative chambers in Minnesota and Michigan and governorships in Massachusetts and Maryland. The GOP flipped one governorship, in Nevada, loosening Democrats¡¯ grip on a state where that party maintained control of both legislative chambers.

Overall, Republicans and Democrats now share power at either the legislative or gubernatorial levels in 11 states.

Statehouse control has become increasingly important as both Democrats and Republicans push for changes to election administration laws and the U.S. Supreme Court has handed states the power to determine policy on issues such as abortion, gun control and LGBT rights. Republicans have held more than 20 state trifectas every year since 2011, though the number of Democratic trifectas has grown in recent years.   


In many cases, the party wielding power in trifecta states controls redistricting: Legislative committees come up with the new maps, the legislature approves them and the governor signs them. In 2021, Republicans controlled mapmaking in 20 of the 35 states where legislatures oversaw redistricting. Because of this state-level dynamic, most political analysts agree that Republicans have had an advantage in the redistricting process.

Republicans began making inroads in state government in the 1990s, particularly in the South and Midwest. Among states in the South, as defined by the Census Bureau, only Maryland and Delaware are fully controlled by Democrats. Despite Democrats¡¯ gains in Michigan and Minnesota, Republicans have the edge in the Midwest. (Nebraska has a unicameral legislature that is officially nonpartisan, although the majority of members are Republicans.)

Sasha Wiesen sleeps with a .40-caliber handgun in a safe by his bed. The commercial real-estate broker from Florida recently preordered a new type of firearm he hopes will make the safe unnecessary.

The new weapon is the Colorado startup Biofire¡¯s 9mm Smart Gun, which can only be fired if it recognizes an authorized user with a fingerprint reader on the grip or a facial recognition camera on the back.

¡°I¡¯m usually an early adapter,¡± said Wiesen, 46 years old. ¡°It might be the gadget part of me that made me buy it, but it¡¯s also the safety aspect.¡±

Guns that use technology to ensure that they can only be fired by their owners, called smart guns, have been developed and debated since the 1990s. The Biofire Smart Gun will be the first widely available for sale if it ships in December as planned. 

Proponents tout smart guns as a way to reduce accidental shootings and firearm thefts. Gun-rights supporters have been wary, in part over concern that governments could outlaw sales of weapons that don¡¯t have smart-gun technology. 

Earlier efforts to bring smart guns to market have failed, largely because of pressure from gun-rights activists or because they didn¡¯t work as promised.

As with other technologies such as electric cars that changed long-established products, the question for smart guns is whether they can work at least as well as the traditional versions they replace and find customers behind affluent early adopters.

The Biofire Smart Gun costs $1,499. Similar handguns without high-tech features typically cost between $400 and $800.

Many gun owners remain skeptical about a firearm with high-tech features, said Michael Schwartz, executive director of San Diego County Gun Owners, a local gun-rights group.

¡°For most of our members, the primary purpose for owning a firearm is self-defense, so simple is better,¡± he said. ¡°It has to be 110% reliable.¡±  

Biofire founder Kai Kloepfer, 26, has been working on the technology since he was a teenager. He said he had built the fingerprint and facial-recognition systems so that if one function doesn¡¯t work because a person¡¯s hands are wet or the person¡¯s face isn¡¯t yet in view, the other will.  

Biofire was founded in 2014 and has raised $30 million in funding from sources including venture capitalist Ron Conway, who has promoted smart-gun technology since the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012, and Peter Thiel¡¯s Founders Fund. The school shooting in Newtown, Conn., left 20 children and six adults dead.

Kloepfer said thousands of people had placed preorders for the Smart Gun, which is only available online, but declined to give a specific number.

During a media demonstration earlier this year, the Biofire gun malfunctioned. Kloepfer said the weapon jammed?but there were no issues with its fingerprint or facial- recognition systems.

Kloepfer said he wasn¡¯t a fan of smart-gun mandates, which some gun-control supporters have pushed in an effort to spur sales. Cooperating with such efforts could alienate potential Biofire customers who support gun rights. 

New Jersey has a law, opposed by Second Amendment groups, mandating that all stores offer a smart gun for sale once one hits the market. Kloepfer said he wouldn¡¯t submit the Biofire Smart Gun to the state¡¯s Personalized Handgun Authorization Commission, which would make the law go into effect.

¡°We¡¯ve taken a very strong anti-mandate stance for smart guns,¡± he said. ¡°I firmly believe that this has to be a choice.¡±

The firearms manufacturer Colt was among the first companies to develop a smart gun, in the 1990s. The Colt Z-40 was designed to fire only when the shooter wore a bracelet that emitted a coded radio signal. But it didn¡¯t work during a demonstration for The Wall Street Journal, and gun owners boycotted the company over its decision to develop it. The Z-40 never made it to market.

A German company, Armatix, developed a .22-caliber smart pistol in the 2010s that used a radio-frequency identification watch worn by the owner. But gun shops dropped plans to carry it in 2014 after objections from gun-rights activists. 

In addition to stressing the pointlessness of smart-gun thefts, advocates for the weapons have argued that they could prevent children from accidentally firing their parents¡¯ firearms or teens from using them in school shootings or suicides. A 2003 study by gun-violence researchers found that 37% of accidental shootings could have been prevented by such technology.

A 2019 study by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health found that gun-owners who already stored their guns safely were 50% more likely to buy a smart gun, suggesting that their impact might be limited. The study also found that while about eight in 10 gun owners supported the sale of smart guns, two in 10 were likely to buy one.

Other startups are working on smart guns, though none plan to start shipping their product as soon as Biofire. Tom Holland, president of Kansas-based Free State Firearms, said his company was using a radio-frequency identification ring worn by the user. 

¡°When people hear about the fingerprint swipe, it¡¯s like, Oh, God, I can¡¯t open up my cellphone half the time,¡± Holland said of the technology used by Biofire.

Holland said Free State plans to introduce the gun early next year. He said the weapon is being tested by half a dozen police agencies and that he has received a handful of preorders from consumers.

Wiesen, who previously worked in law enforcement, said he was drawn to the Biofire Smart Gun¡¯s customizable aesthetics as much as its safety features. He ordered his in all-white.

¡°There¡¯s something when you¡¯re at the range and shooting your gun, there¡¯s a cool factor involved,¡± he said.",WSJ

WASHINGTON?Rep. Adam Schiff drew a high-profile endorsement in his bid for a California U.S. Senate seat, with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi saying she would support him if current Sen. Dianne Feinstein opts not to run for re-election in 2024.

The endorsement from the fellow California lawmaker gives Mr. Schiff, 62 years old, a boost in what is expected to be a crowded and expensive race against other Democratic hopefuls. Mr. Schiff has been a close ally of Mrs. Pelosi, who quit the leadership after the Democrats lost control of the chamber but remains an influential figure in the House and a powerful fundraiser in the party.

In a statement Thursday, Mrs. Pelosi praised Mrs. Feinstein and her record on issues including gun control and domestic violence, adding she has her wholehearted support if she decides to run for re-election. In backing Mr. Schiff, Mrs. Pelosi said he ¡°knows well the nexus between a strong Democracy and a strong economy.¡±

Mrs. Feinstein is 89 years old and has faced questions about whether she is still up to serving in the Senate. In a brief interview, Mrs. Feinstein said that she would make a decision in the spring about whether to run again.

Rep. Katie Porter (D., Calif.) has also jumped into the race, and she has been endorsed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.), while Rep. Barbara Lee (D., Calif.) is also expected to run. Another California Democrat, Rep. Ro Khanna, is considering whether to enter the race.

Under state election law, the top two vote-getters in the open primary race regardless of party will advance to the November 2024 general election.

Mrs. Pelosi had picked Mr. Schiff to serve as the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee when she served as speaker, and he managed the first impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump. But new House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) stripped Mr. Schiff of his spot on the panel, accusing him of politicizing the position. Another Democrat, Rep. Jim Himes of California, will now be the panel¡¯s top Democrat.

Mr. Schiff is a top fundraiser in the party. But his past efforts to take on bigger roles have hit setbacks. California¡¯s Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom in 2020 tapped ally Alex Padilla for an open Senate seat despite lobbying by Mrs. Pelosi for Mr. Schiff. Mr. Schiff also explored making a bid to serve as House minority leader, but the campaign never caught fire and Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D., N.Y.) was elected to the post.",WSJ

William Galston¡¯s assertion that 2022 was ¡°a pretty good year for the U.S.¡± is a strained effort to see the glass as half full (¡°Democracy Made a Comeback in 2022,¡± Politics & Ideas, Dec. 28). The suggestion that President Biden ¡°forged an effective international alliance against Russia¡¯s invasion of Ukraine¡± disguises the administration¡¯s singular diplomatic failure: its inability to persuade President Vladimir Putin not to mount an invasion.

The ¡°much-needed boost in military spending¡± came at far too high a price: a nearly commensurate increase in domestic spending. This on the heels of multitrillion-dollar domestic expenditures cast as pandemic-relief measures.

True, former President Donald Trump has been weakened, but as Mr. Galston acknowledges, he still has a path back to power. Let¡¯s hope 2023 isn¡¯t another ¡°pretty good¡± year.

Rhapsodizing about the ¡°legislation forged by shifting bipartisan coalitions,¡± Mr. Galston enumerates ¡°a string of achievements.¡± Among them is ¡°the most significant gun-safety bill in decades.¡±

Two questions: First, is a ¡°gun-safety bill¡± a euphemism for a ¡°gun-control bill¡±? Second, how does the gun-safety bill earn the designation ¡°significant¡±? If the designation is predicated on the effectiveness of that bill, should we expect statistically significant drops in the homicide rates for cities such as Baltimore, Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, New Orleans, Newark, N.J., Stockton, Calif., and Oakland, Calif.?

Without significant drops in gun violence and homicides, what does ¡°significant¡± actually signify?

WASHINGTON?Susan Rice, President Biden¡¯s top domestic policy adviser, is departing the administration, the White House said Monday.

Ms. Rice, a longtime foreign-policy expert, has led the White House Domestic Policy Council since the start of the administration, helping coordinate with federal agencies on a broad variety of issues, including economic mobility, healthcare, gun control and immigration. Her last day will be May 26, an administration official said.

In a statement, President Biden thanked Ms. Rice for her service, saying, ¡°??there is no one more capable, and more determined to get important things done for the American people than Susan Rice.¡±  

He praised Ms. Rice for her work on health policy, including on lowering prescription drug prices for seniors.

In a tweet, Ms. Rice said she was ¡°so proud of all we have been able to accomplish together for the American people.¡±

Neera Tanden, the White House staff secretary, is seen by some inside the West Wing as a contender to replace Ms. Rice, according to people familiar with the matter. Ms. Rice¡¯s departure had been rumored for months.

Ms. Rice served as United Nations ambassador at the beginning of the Obama administration and later became President Barack Obama¡¯s national security adviser during his second term. During that period, she worked closely with then-Vice President Biden, often meeting with him during daily intelligence briefings.

During the 2020 campaign, Ms. Rice was under consideration to be Mr. Biden¡¯s running mate and was also discussed as a potential secretary of state during the president¡¯s transition.

As the administration¡¯s leader of the Domestic Policy Council, Ms. Rice didn¡¯t need to receive Senate confirmation. If she had been nominated to a different position, she would have likely faced opposition from Senate Republicans for her foreign policy role during the Obama administration.

Republicans have criticized Ms. Rice for initially characterizing the deadly 2012 attacks on Americans in Benghazi, Libya, as an episode of spontaneous protest hijacked by extremists instead of a premeditated terrorist attack. They have also accused her of spying on Michael Flynn, former President Donald Trump¡¯s first national security adviser.

A 2014 House of Representatives report on the Libya incident found that while public statements by Ms. Rice and other U.S. officials were proven wrong, the inaccuracies stemmed from poor intelligence. Declassified records, meanwhile, have shown no evidence she improperly accessed information about Mr. Flynn.

After leaving the Obama administration, Ms. Rice joined the Netflix Inc. board of directors in May 2018. Ms. Rice sold a significant portion of her Netflix shares in August 2020 as she was being considered to be Mr. Biden¡¯s running mate.",WSJ

Kathy Hochul Says Her Focus Is on Crime and Housing?With Less Brashness in Albany,"ALBANY, N.Y.?New York Gov. Kathy Hochul enters her first full-term facing an uncertain economy, elevated crime and a dire housing crunch. She said she wants to tackle all those things while also changing the culture in the state capital, which has long been known for rough-and-tumble politics and high-profile clashes that she and other leaders say stifled collaboration.

Ms. Hochul, a Democrat, was inaugurated Sunday as the first woman elected governor of the Empire State. The former lieutenant governor first assumed the office in 2021 following former Gov. Andrew Cuomo¡®s resignation, which came amid a sexual-harassment scandal.

Even as she responded to new waves of Covid-19 and a damaging hurricane, Ms. Hochul said from the outset that she wanted to show that a collaborative approach could work in a state characterized by politicians with big ambitions and egos?almost all of whom were men. In a recent interview, Ms. Hochul reflected on her closer-than-expected election victory over GOP Rep. Lee Zeldin and said she would heed lessons from years of work on the local political stage, much of which was out of the spotlight in the suburbs of Buffalo.

Mr. Zeldin focused on crime and the state¡¯s cash-bail laws, which he blamed for the 20% increase in major crimes in New York City between 2021 and 2022. The governor was slow during the campaign to address the attacks, said Democratic political strategist Bradley Honan, and her 6.4-percentage-point margin of victory was the closest in decades in a race few analysts thought would be competitive. Democrats have a greater than two-to-one advantage among registered voters in the state.

Ms. Hochul, 64 years old, said that she had long focused on public safety, including stricter gun control laws. But she said even some fellow Democrats expected her to fail and that she met voters who said they wouldn¡¯t support her because ¡°they weren¡¯t sure a woman had the toughness that it takes to do this job.¡±

¡°I knew I had to set out and prove [that] they¡¯re all wrong,¡± she told The Wall Street Journal, sitting in her Capitol office decorated with artifacts of the women¡¯s suffrage movement. 

¡°There¡¯s an inner confidence that allows me to go into situations where I don¡¯t have to be the loudest voice in the room,¡± Ms. Hochul said. ¡°I can bring people together¡¦and let them know I¡¯m listening, but I also have strong opinions.¡±

Women will lead 12 states this year, the highest number ever, according to the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. Forty-nine women have served as U.S. governors, and 11 first assumed the office?like Ms. Hochul?by constitutional succession.

The governor is expected to outline her agenda in a speech next week. She said in the interview that she would continue to focus on public safety and rising housing costs??the median monthly rent for a Manhattan apartment now exceeds $4,000?and promised to stem population loss in her inauguration speech. New York lost 220,000 residents in the year that ended July 1, the Census Bureau said, which is more than any other state.

Democrats control all parts of New York¡¯s state government, and Ms. Hochul is starting her year with an intraparty clash. More than a dozen Democratic senators, including many from the party¡¯s progressive flank, objected to the governor¡¯s nomination of Justice Hector LaSalle to lead the New York State Court of Appeals.

Legislators said they have concerns with Judge LaSalle¡¯s previous rulings on workers¡¯ rights. Ms. Hochul said she stands by the nomination of the first Latino chief judge.

Ms. Hochul said she has also made it a priority?working with New York City Mayor Eric Adams?to revive New York City business districts that were hollowed out by the pandemic. The Hochul-Adams relationship is notably warmer than that between their predecessors, Mr. Cuomo and former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio. The men fought over everything from whether to keep schools open during the pandemic to the fate of a stray deer that made its way into Harlem.

Kathleen Courtney was the eldest daughter of six children in a devoutly Catholic household. She was born in a trailer park near the Bethlehem Steel mill outside Buffalo. She recalled watching her siblings while her father worked or went to night school and her mother volunteered on various social causes, including civil rights.

After graduating from Catholic University¡¯s law school in Washington, D.C., she married fellow lawyer William Hochul in 1984. Ms. Hochul worked for several years on Capitol Hill, including for Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D., N.Y.). She said her work ethic was steeled when she came to the office on a Saturday morning to catch up on an assignment and saw the senator alone in his office, working on a book.

Ms. Hochul said she always assumed she would stay behind the scenes. When she and Mr. Hochul moved their family back to the Buffalo area in 1991, she started volunteering for the Democratic Party in the suburb of Hamburg and attending town board meetings. Her spark to run for office came when a 21-year-old man just out of college, Tom Quatroche, won a board seat.

¡°That was my wake-up moment,¡± she said. Though she didn¡¯t run for the seat at that point, she thought she was more qualified and had greater standing in the town. In 1994, she was appointed to a vacant board seat and later elected.

Mr. Quatroche said Ms. Hochul learned to develop a thick skin during public comment sessions and to weigh opposing viewpoints. In one example, Ms. Hochul forged a compromise that allowed a store to come to Hamburg, with changes to its location and facade.

Ms. Hochul later became Erie County Clerk?overseeing the motor-vehicle department?and served a year in Congress after she won a special election. Mr. Cuomo tapped her to be his running mate in 2014. Without a major policy portfolio in Mr. Cuomo¡¯s administration, she spent her time representing the governor at local events around the state.

Mr. Cuomo pushed to remove Ms. Hochul from the ticket in 2018 to replace her with a person of color, according to people familiar with the matter, but she refused to go. (A spokesman for Mr. Cuomo didn¡¯t dispute this.) She didn¡¯t play a role in Mr. Cuomo¡¯s management of the pandemic, which insulated her from criticism of his response to it.

Mr. Cuomo resigned in August 2021 after a state report concluded he sexually harassed multiple women, including state employees. The former governor has denied touching anyone inappropriately and said investigations into his conduct were politically motivated.

Ms. Hochul quickly established a contrast in style. Before pushing schools to reopen in person with mandatory masking in 2021, she convened with school superintendents and teachers¡¯ unions. County executives in the state said they were surprised to be invited for a working breakfast at the governor¡¯s mansion.

In December, Ms. Hochul shared the stage with Mr. Adams to discuss a plan for reviving the city¡¯s business districts at a breakfast convened by the Association for a Better New York civic group. The pair convened a group that recommended a series of parks and promenades throughout some of the busiest parts of Manhattan, suggesting major changes to reposition office-centric neighborhoods for the postpandemic world. Business executives including Goldman Sachs chief executive David Solomon helped draft the report.

Governors and mayors have feuded for decades and the conflict often let problems fester, ABNY chairman Steven Rubenstein said. Ms. Hochul and Mr. Adams were the first governmental leaders to make a joint appearance at the group in 50 years. ¡°She believes there can be a win-win,¡± Mr. Rubenstein said. ¡°It used to be like professional wrestling.¡±

Ms. Hochul successfully pushed lawmakers last year to partially roll back a law that prohibited cash bail for most misdemeanor and nonviolent felony charges. She secured $600 million of state funding for a new Buffalo Bills football stadium. Progressives in the legislature objected to both moves.

After a mass shooter murdered 10 people in Buffalo and the Supreme Court eliminated the constitutional right to an abortion, Ms. Hochul pushed for adding abortion access to the state¡¯s constitution, as well as stricter gun controls. The gun laws are now the subject of legal challenges.

As Mr. Zeldin¡¯s campaign picked up steam, Ms. Hochul attacked Mr. Zeldin¡¯s ties to Donald Trump and his opposition to abortion rights. Still, she promised few specific new initiatives, and some Democratic officials said it was hard to articulate her agenda.

Looking toward her first elected term, she has promised to create 800,000 housing units over the next decade but hasn¡¯t detailed specific steps to achieve the goal. She also plans to propose additional funding for mass transit.

State Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, who broke up the ¡°three men in a room¡± who negotiated budgets and major laws with her ascent to the post in 2019, said she appreciated Ms. Hochul¡¯s approach.

¡°As long as we continue to be communicative and collaborative and we¡¯re working based on policies and not personality, I think we¡¯ll be able to do fine,¡± Ms. Stewart-Cousins said. ¡°And New Yorkers will benefit from it.¡±",WSJ

A tough new Oregon law set to go into effect this week has been thrown into legal limbo, leaving residents and gun dealers confused about the future of firearm sales in their state. 

Passed by voters last month, Measure 114 would require residents to get permits to buy firearms and would prohibit the sale and manufacture of magazines that hold more than 10 rounds. If enacted, it would be one of the most stringent in the country.

Gun-rights groups filed a flurry of lawsuits challenging the law in federal and state courts. On Tuesday, Harney County Circuit Court Judge Robert Raschio temporarily blocked the law from going into effect, saying it violated the right to bear arms in the state constitution. That decision came hours after a federal judge said the law could go into effect.

¡°Everyone is basically trying to figure out what¡¯s going on,¡± said Austin Cock, a manager at Tick Licker Firearms LLC, which has stores in Salem and Corvallis, Ore.

On Thursday, Ellen Rosenblum, the state¡¯s attorney general, tried to offer some clarity to residents in a message on Twitter.

¡°If you¡¯re wondering about the legal status of Measure 114, the law¡¯s enforcement is (we hope temporarily) on hold by the state courts,¡± it said. ¡°We will continue to defend the constitutionality of this voter-passed gun safety law.¡±

Gun-rights groups say they are confident they will prevail in tossing out the Oregon law following a U.S. Supreme Court decision in June that significantly expanded gun rights. The high court struck down New York state¡¯s system for issuing concealed-weapons permits and set a new constitutional test for gun-control measures: They must be consistent with the nation¡¯s historical tradition of firearms regulation.

¡°This law will not survive,¡± said Alan Gottlieb, founder of the Second Amendment Foundation, which is challenging the Oregon law in court.

The Oregon law would require residents to take a safety course and pass a background check to obtain a license to purchase guns. It would also mandate background checks to be completed before a gun can be sold. Under federal law, guns can be transferred after three days if the check isn¡¯t completed.

A handful of states such as Illinois and Connecticut require a license to buy all types of firearms. Meanwhile, 12 other states have restrictions on the size of magazines. 

Researchers have found that permit-to-purchase laws are associated with lower levels of suicides, homicides and mass shootings, according to the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Studies have also shown that restrictions on high-capacity magazines are linked to reductions in the number of people injured and killed in mass shootings, though not to the number of incidents. But states have also struggled to enforce such restrictions on magazines.

Lift Every Voice Oregon, a group of Oregon faith leaders that campaigned for the new gun measure, said the law should be allowed to go into effect. The judge ¡°acknowledges mass shootings but is okay if they continue,¡± the group said on its Facebook page. The campaign didn¡¯t respond to requests for comment.

The group has been pushing for stricter gun laws in Oregon in recent years following the 2018 Parkland, Fla., high-school massacre.

Mr. Cock, the gun-store manager, disagrees with the new law, saying that permits to purchase guns are unnecessary since everyone must undergo a background check to buy firearms.

Meanwhile, customers who are worried the new law will make purchasing guns much more difficult are rushing in to buy them, he said.

¡°We¡¯ve had lines out the door for several weeks,¡± said Mr. Cock.",WSJ
https://www.wsj.com/articles/young-voters-on-biden-hes-just-so-old-7ebe2700?mod=Searchresults_pos8&page=3,2023-05-13,Young Voters on Biden: ¡®He¡¯s Just So Old¡¯,"President Biden faces a problem in turning out the young voters he needs to clinch a second White House term: Many are worried about his age and performance in office.

With graduation season unfolding around the country, interviews with students at colleges and universities, some of whom supported Mr. Biden in 2020, found frustration with his tenure. At 80, Mr. Biden, the oldest president in U.S. history, is more than a half-century older than the college students who will go to the polls next year.

While most voters interviewed by The Wall Street Journal had concerns about Donald Trump winning another term, some said they wanted to explore other options in the Democratic primary and might not show up on Election Day if Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump are on the ticket.

Ari Smith, 22, a recent graduate living in Tempe, Ariz., said the presidential election was ¡°like choosing which poison is safer to drink.¡± She has been disappointed with Mr. Biden¡¯s performance in office but said she would likely vote for him because he is more aligned with her on supporting protections for LGBT people and access to abortion than Mr. Trump.

The president is expected to secure the Democratic nomination, though he is being challenged by two long-shot candidates. Mr. Trump faces a crowded field of Republicans for his party¡¯s nomination, but holds a commanding lead in most polling.

Young voters have long been a pillar of the Democratic coalition, but there are signs that their enthusiasm for the party is diminishing. 

In the 2018 midterm elections, Democratic House candidates won support from 64% of voters under age 30, and Mr. Biden won 61% in 2020, according to a large yearly survey of the electorate called AP VoteCast. But support for Democrats among voters in that age group fell to 54% in last year¡¯s midterms.

While younger Americans have traditionally voted at lower rates than older groups, turnout among those under age 25 slipped by nearly 5 percentage points from 2018 to 2022, compared with only 1 percentage point among voters overall, the Census Bureau reported this month. A different survey that included voters in their late 20s showed higher levels of engagement. VoteCast found that people under age 30 grew to 13% of all voters who cast ballots in the 2022 midterms, up from 12% in the prior midterm, in 2018. 

Recent polling suggests that younger voters are disengaged from politics. In a March survey of 18- to 29-year-olds, Harvard¡¯s Institute of Politics found that 71% described themselves as not politically engaged or politically active, and that more than half, some 56%, say they don¡¯t follow politics closely or don¡¯t follow politics at all.

The Biden campaign ¡°needs to spend 2023 learning from and talking to these voters and people and figuring out how to best connect with them and not sort of pretending there¡¯s not an issue, because there is,¡± said Jim Messina, who was former President Barack Obama¡¯s campaign manager in 2012. 

Biden campaign spokesman Kevin Munoz said the president is giving priority to issues that young voters care about, including climate change and student loans. ¡°As we did in 2020, we are going to work hard to earn every American¡¯s vote by using innovative ways to reach them, and highlighting the stakes of this election,¡± he said in a statement.

In a commencement address at Howard University in Washington on Saturday, Mr. Biden said:  ¡°We¡¯re living through one of the most consequential moments in our history, with fundamental questions at stake for our nation. Who are we? What do we stand for? What do we believe? Who will we be?¡± 

He added: ¡°You¡¯re going to help answer those questions.¡±  

Jack Trudeau, 22, a recent Arizona State University graduate, said he would support the Democratic nominee but would rather see a fresh face. ¡°I think he¡¯s done a good job so far, but he¡¯s just so old,¡± he said about Mr. Biden. Mr. Trump is 76 years old. 

Karly Rickman, 20, a junior at the University of Kentucky, who supported Mr. Biden in 2020, is the kind of voter Mr. Biden¡¯s team needs to win back. Ms. Rickman said she wants to know more about the other candidates before deciding whom to support, though she is unlikely to vote for Mr. Trump.

¡°I was more positive toward the beginning and now that positivity is kind of fading,¡± she said about Mr. Biden. 

In an April Wall Street Journal survey, 27% of voters under age 26 were undecided on whether they would vote for Mr. Biden or Mr. Trump in a 2024 presidential rematch, or else only leaned toward one of those two candidates. That compared with 19% of all voters who were undecided or not firm in their selection in a potential rematch.

Molly Murphy, a Democratic pollster who worked on the Journal survey, said young voters typically engage in an election late in the process, and that there were few signs that young Democrats would switch parties to back the GOP. ¡°But I think what we¡¯re seeing now is a higher level of cynicism and a lack of party attachment,¡± she said. ¡°When you combine that with lower turnout rates, it¡¯s less about worrying that these voters are going to vote Republican and more about making sure they vote.¡±

The Democratic National Committee is trying to mobilize young voters around issues that strategists believe resonate with them, including abortion, gun violence and student debt. America, a progressive group focused on youth voting that endorsed Mr. Biden¡¯s re-election bid earlier this month, plans to have a presence on hundreds of college campuses and make contact with millions of young voters ahead of next year¡¯s election. 

Cristina Tzintz?n Ramirez, the group¡¯s president, said NextGen will make the case that Mr. Biden is a progressive leader who has earned the vote of young people through his action to address climate change, decrease student debt and push for gun control. ¡°It¡¯s not just a question of turnout. It¡¯s also a question of persuasion,¡± she said.

The Biden campaign is planning to lean on young and liberal lawmakers to help sell the president to young voters.

Rep. Maxwell Frost (D., Fla.), 26, who was one of the youngest candidates to ever be elected to the House of Representatives, recently joined the Biden campaign¡¯s national advisory board. He said Washington is underestimating the political power of Generation Z, generally considered those born in 1997 or later. ¡°This generation is heavily voting for Democrats. It¡¯s the most progressive generation in the history of our country,¡± he said, adding that Democrats need to engage with young voters on social media. 

For voters like Meera Herle, who just finished her junior year at the University of Michigan, Mr. Biden¡¯s support for gun control is key to earning her support. ¡°For college-age students who are voting in this election, we have all grown up with drills to prepare in the event of a mass shooting,¡± she said.

Many of the young voters The Wall Street Journal spoke to cited Mr. Biden¡¯s efforts to forgive student loan debt as a positive for the president. The Supreme Court is currently deliberating whether the loan-forgiveness program is constitutional.

¡°The impact of the student-loan forgiveness program would be huge for me,¡± said Hannah Walters, 25, who lives in Blacksburg, Va., and has about $55,000 in student loans. She said she voted for Mr. Biden in 2020 and plans to support him again.

Some voters said Mr. Biden hasn¡¯t accomplished as much as he said he would.

Yaelin Garcia, 21, a student at Arizona State University, said Mr. Biden¡¯s approval of an oil drilling project in the Alaskan Arctic ¡°is literally destroying our world even quicker than at the rate we¡¯re going. Instead of making things better, he¡¯s making it worse.¡± She said she won¡¯t vote for Mr. Trump, but is undecided on whether it is worth showing up on Election Day. 

Democrats will also need to win over new voters like Karolina Marquez, 20, another ASU student, who is not sure if she¡¯ll vote or whom she would support. She said she is unlikely to vote for Mr. Trump, but she hasn¡¯t ruled him out entirely because she blames Mr. Biden for the state of the economy.

Mr. Trump¡¯s ¡°persona I don¡¯t agree with,¡± she said citing his treatment of women and comments about undocumented immigrants who enter the U.S. illegally. ¡°But he¡¯s a really smart man.¡±  ",WSJ

People seeking concealed-weapons permits in New Jersey would have to obtain insurance for their firearms under a proposal introduced Thursday by the Democratic leaders of the state¡¯s legislature. The proposal, if passed into law, would make New Jersey the first state with such a requirement.

The legislation would require applicants to purchase liability insurance to cover any claims arising from the ownership, maintenance, operation or use of a firearm carried in public. It would also mandate in-person training and prohibit the possession of firearms in 24 types of sensitive places including bars, parks, schools and hospitals.

New Jersey Senate President Nicholas Scutari said the bill is the latest state response to a June U.S. Supreme Court ruling that struck down New York¡¯s weapons permitting regime and called into question the laws of a half-dozen other states, including New Jersey. The Democrat said the insurance requirement is analogous to auto insurance.

¡°Those are pretty dangerous machines. Not nearly as dangerous as a firearm,¡± he said.

New Jersey would be the first state to require liability insurance to possess a handgun in public, said Adam Skaggs, policy director and chief counsel of the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a gun-control group. The city of San Jose, Calif., adopted similar requirements earlier this year.

It is already possible to purchase the type of insurance policies that would be required under the bill, said Insurance Council of New Jersey Vice President Gary La Spisa. The policies are considered specialized and none of his association¡¯s members currently offer them, he said.

The Supreme Court invalidated New York¡¯s requirement that people demonstrate ¡°proper cause¡±?held by courts to mean demonstrating ¡°a special need for self-protection distinguishable from that of the general community¡±?to receive a concealed-carry permit. It also said state-based firearm regulations should be evaluated based on whether they are ¡°consistent with the nation¡¯s historical tradition of firearm regulation.¡±

New Jersey¡¯s existing gun law requires a person to show a ¡°justifiable need¡± to be issued a concealed-weapons permit. The legislation would repeal that language but instead prohibit the issuance of a license to a person ¡°lacking the essential character of temperament necessary to be entrusted with a firearm.¡±

Federal judges have cited the Supreme Court ruling in striking down other state-based firearm restrictions, including a Delaware law that criminalized the possession or manufacture of unserialized, homemade firearms.

Last week, U.S. District Court Glenn Suddaby of Syracuse said parts of a recently enacted New York law were likely unconstitutional. He said the state¡¯s requirement that gun owners demonstrate good moral character was too burdensome and gave licensing officers too much subjective leeway to deny permits. He also struck down restrictions on carrying guns in bars and New York City¡¯s Times Square.

An appellate court said New York officials can keep enforcing the law while an appellate panel considers their appeal of Judge Suddaby¡¯s ruling.

New Jersey Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin said members of his Democratic-controlled chamber plan to vote on the bill this month. Mr. Scutari said no vote has been scheduled. A spokeswoman for Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, said the bill was consistent with proposals the governor has made and he looks forward to signing it.

Alejandro Roubian, president and managing editor of the New Jersey Second Amendment Society, said the bill would make obtaining a concealed-weapons permit overly burdensome and said that it suffered from the same legal issues as the New York law.

When I was growing up on the South Side of Chicago in the late 1950s, almost every boy had one treasured possession: a holster with two six-shooters. It was the essential toy for playing Cowboys and Indians, the most popular game in town. Regrettably at the time, my brother and I didn¡¯t get in on the fun. Our father wouldn¡¯t allow it.

He had his reasons: In depriving us of the revolvers, he often would cite his experience during World War II. Our father served in the French army and, as a member of an artillery regiment, fought the Nazis when they marched into Belgium. During that service, a rifle shot grazed the back of his neck and came close to taking his life. He made it clear that, having been wounded and seen the horrors wrought by firearms, he didn¡¯t believe anyone should think of such weapons as playthings.

Though as a child I sometimes resented not fitting in with my friends, I grew to accept that firearms were terrible devices that didn¡¯t belong in our lives. As an adult, for many years I supported banning guns among civilians, even contemplating the merits of repealing the Second Amendment.

But some months ago my thinking changed again. Today, my wife has a gun that she keeps in our home. She has the necessary permits from the authorities and has trained extensively in using the gun safely. Growing up, I never imagined I would have a firearm at home. But I am reassured to have one, even if I¡¯ve never held it myself.

Our decision to acquire a gun is due to the recent release of the man who bludgeoned my wife¡¯s younger sister to death several decades ago. My wife fears that the murderer, released from prison during the Covid-19 pandemic by New York state¡¯s board of parole, poses a potential threat to us.

But our decision also is due to society¡¯s current dysfunction. Crime is surging in our city?Washington?and around the country. Vagrants wander the streets, police are reluctant to tackle criminals, and courts seem unwilling to impose serious sentences on those who break the law. Given these circumstances, owning a gun seems to be one of the few ways to feel even a semblance of personal safety. There is an irony that policies progressives espouse, such as gun control, have prompted us to have a gun in our home.

Progressives nationwide have attacked police and law enforcement, alleging that our legal system is systemically racist and oppressive. They have caused recidivist criminals to haunt our streets and commit more crimes?and have refused to deal with homelessness in spite of the mental illness and drug addictions that so often afflict our cities¡¯ most vulnerable. Numerous efforts to reduce the use of drugs have been rebuffed in the name, of course, of racism.

This approach has unleashed a crime wave and diminished our sense of safety on the streets. It is, therefore, unsurprising to see ever more law-abiding people seeking to arm themselves. As a result, there will be more guns out there, including in the hands of people who should never be near them.

To limit guns in America, much as my father wished, policy makers should focus on the underlying problems that are generating a spike in crime. It is disingenuous and hypocritical to argue that Americans should disarm themselves while at the same time depriving them of protection against those who would inflict a kind of anarchy on us. Society can¡¯t thrive if it won¡¯t stand up for itself. The absence of such protection will merely lead people to take up arms themselves.

This is what is happening to our family?once vigorously anti-firearm and now reluctantly in possession of one. The ultimate concern is that a steadily arming population will someday use those weapons in a civil conflict. It would be wise to stop undermining our citizens¡¯ security and thereby avoid such a dire fate.

Republican attorneys general of 24 states are warning and not to move forward with their plan to add a new code to identify when purchases are made at firearms retailers.

The attorneys general said in a letter that the card companies¡¯ plan could lead to the misuse of consumer data and wouldn¡¯t protect the public.

¡°Categorizing the constitutionally protected right to purchase firearms unfairly singles out law-abiding merchants and consumers alike,¡± their letter to the three companies says. The letter, a draft of which was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, was sent Tuesday.

The effort was led by the offices of Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti and Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen.

Offices of attorneys general were signing onto the letter until last night, with Virginia¡¯s office joining this morning.

Visa, Mastercard and Amex use merchant-category codes, or MCCs, to identify types of merchants by the goods and services they sell. The companies said earlier this month that they would add a new code for firearms retailers, who have long been categorized under broader groups such as specialty retailers or durable-goods sellers. The new code was recently approved by an international entity that sets standards for the payments industry.

Gun-control advocates have pressed the financial industry to do more to help curb mass shootings, though it has been an uphill climb. They say the new merchant code could help identify suspicious gun sales.

Gun-rights advocates have long resisted such efforts, saying they could unfairly prevent legal gun purchases.

In interviews, both Mr. Knudsen and Mr. Skrmetti said they could launch investigations into the companies if they moved forward with the gun-shop code.

¡°We will marshal the full scope of our lawful authority to protect our citizens and consumers from unlawful attempts to undermine their constitutional rights,¡± their letter said.

Merchant codes generally don¡¯t identify the product a card user is buying. Instead, they describe the type of store where a purchase was made. That means transactions with the gun-shop MCC might involve gun purchases, hunting gear or a gun safe, among other things.

The payments industry has long been divided on whether to assign MCCs to gun shops. Some executives have privately flagged concerns that it could lead to the creation of more codes for cracking down on businesses such as abortion providers.

Visa, Mastercard and Amex say the new merchant code will function just like others and won¡¯t stop gun purchases from happening. The companies say they won¡¯t allow purchases to be blocked based solely on the merchant code.

¡°We do not believe private companies should serve as moral arbiters,¡± Visa said in a post last week.

¡°If we identify unauthorized blocking or intentional restrictions of legal commerce, we will take swift action to address such activity,¡± Mastercard said recently.

Sen. Roger Marshall (R., Kan.) recently sent a letter to the three companies saying that lawmakers would intercede to prevent card networks and issuers from doing ¡°an end run¡± around the Second Amendment. The letter was signed by 11 other Republican senators.

Amalgamated Bank applied for the code to the standards-setting group that determines MCCs. At a news conference last week, Priscilla Sims Brown, Amalgamated¡¯s chief executive, said banks had the responsibility to report illegal activity that took place over their payment systems.

The attorneys general of New York and California, both Democrats, have said the card companies should begin tracking gun sales and flagging suspicious purchases to law enforcement. At the news conference last week, New York Attorney General Letitia James referenced mass shooters using cards to buy guns.

The Biden administration is revoking licenses from hundreds of firearms dealers in a significant escalation of federal enforcement actions that has angered many in the gun industry.

It has also provoked disagreement among law-enforcement veterans. Some say it is a welcome change after years of wrist slaps, while others say it risks alienating some of the government¡¯s most valuable sources in combating gun violence.

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has revoked the licenses of 122 gun dealers in the fiscal year that began in October, up from 90 for all last fiscal year and 27 in 2021. 

Previously, ATF issued warnings to many firearms dealers for legal violations, in part because they are a valuable source of tips on suspicious gun buyers. The Trump and Obama administrations never revoked more than 81 dealers¡¯ licenses annually since at least 2013, the earliest year for which data are available. 

Gun dealers have filed lawsuits and threatened to stop informing federal agents about suspicious buyers, claiming that the crackdown is a way to punish the firearms industry by an administration hostile to them.

The Biden administration, which has been pushing to more tightly regulate guns both via legislation and administrative action, said it is simply enforcing the law.

¡°We¡¯ve taken steps to hold accountable those few dealers who are engaging in these willful violations,¡± said ATF Director Steve Dettelbach. ¡°They¡¯re not going to have the privilege of being a gun dealer anymore.¡± 

Dettelbach said guns can end up getting sold to criminals and others who shouldn¡¯t have them if dealers don¡¯t follow the rules.

Gun-store owners complain that the federal government is taking away their livelihoods over paperwork errors. 

¡°We were making $1 million a year, now it¡¯s less than $100,000,¡± said Anthony Navarro, who lost his license last year after receiving three earlier warnings since 2009. ¡°This policy is designed to be a backdoor violation of the Second Amendment.¡± 

Navarro still sells firearm accessories at his Greeley, Colo., store.

The ATF employs about 800 people to inspect more than 50,000 licensed dealers across the country. In the past, the agency had a light touch with inspections in part because it relied on dealers for information about suspicious gun buyers, according to former ATF officials. 

¡°The gun dealers were our first line of defense against gun trafficking,¡± said Peter Forcelli, a retired deputy assistant director. ¡°Why are we now beating an ally into submission?¡±

Other former officials said that the soft approach created an environment in which dealers weren¡¯t worried about breaking the rules. 

¡°The ATF, previous to this administration, had a ¡®Let¡¯s see if we can help you¡¯ attitude and some gun dealers took advantage of that,¡± said Rick Vasquez, a retired ATF official.

President Biden¡¯s tougher approach comes after a yearslong push by gun-control groups such as Brady to go after rogue gun dealers. Brady compiled about 80,000 pages of ATF inspection reports in recent years to highlight the issue.

¡°We could see regularly that recommendations for revocation were being downgraded and then these same stores would be inspected again for even at times even more than a decade,¡± said Christian Heyne, vice president of policy and programs at Brady.

Heyne discovered that an ATF inspector had in 2015 recommended revoking Navarro¡¯s license for his shop in Colorado after sending him warning letters in 2009 and 2011. The 2015 inspection turned up 10 violations, including selling guns to people who said they were prohibited from owning guns on background check forms. An ATF supervisor overturned the recommendation, saying Navarro should be given a warning conference instead, the inspection reports show. 

Navarro said some customers made mistakes when filling out background check forms, but weren¡¯t prohibited from buying firearms.

In 2020, inspectors found more violations, including failing to report multiple sales of handguns and failing to keep records of some transactions. Officials noted that they had warned Navarro to clean up his act on multiple occasions, according to agency documents.

Navarro said he discovered those issues after one of his employees quit. ¡°It was a horrendous mess,¡± he said. ¡°This guy hid forms underneath the printer.¡±

He said he reported the problems to the ATF as soon as he found them. 

The agency revoked his license to sell firearms last year. 

An ATF spokeswoman declined to comment on specific cases.

A North Dakota gun store that recently filed a lawsuit against the ATF alleged that the new approach to inspections is being ¡°wielded as a political weapon.¡± Bridge City Ordnance had sued the agency over an unrelated matter when inspectors recommended revoking its license. Lawyers for the gun store declined to comment, as did the ATF.

Leslie Gifford, an 82-year-old retiree who sold firearms out of his garage in Burlington, Kan., for the past three decades, tried to fight back when the ATF pulled his license last year for several violations including selling a gun to a man from Nebraska. Such sales are required to go through a dealer in the purchaser¡¯s home state.

At a hearing, Gifford said he thought the sale was allowed because the man had a concealed-carry license from Nebraska, and he apologized, according to ATF documents. He attributed other violations to being too busy. 

The ATF wasn¡¯t moved by his pleas, ruling that ¡°there is no legal justification for a licensee¡¯s claim that circumstances, such as being busy or overwhelmed, excuses the failure.¡±

Gifford said he believes the government was determined to revoke his license, rather than reach a reasonable compromise.

¡°Mr. Biden wants to get rid of all of us little dealers,¡± said Gifford. ¡°Gets me wound up, boy. It¡¯s a political game, sure as hell.¡± ",WSJ

On the face of it, America¡¯s rapidly growing Asian population is bad news for the Republican Party. Nearly two-thirds of Asian-Americans prefer Democrats, according to a new Pew survey. Among those under 30, the figure is 88%. But the GOP shouldn¡¯t despair. At one time Asian-Americans mostly voted Republican. They may do so again.

¡°It is true of course that Asian voters have been oriented toward the Democratic Party for quite a while,¡± says Ruy Teixeira, a scholar of American politics at the American Enterprise Institute. ¡°Does that mean they¡¯ll always stay there? Probably not.¡±

Asian-Americans are hardly a monolith. They trace their origins to more than 20 countries. The vast majority (about 80%) belong to six groups?those of Chinese, Indian, Filipino, Korean, Vietnamese and Japanese origin. But even this relatively compact grouping contains a great deal of variation.

Take Indian-Americans and Vietnamese-Americans. The 4.4-million-strong Indian-American community has a median household income of $142,000. Vietnamese-Americans, by contrast, number only 1.9 million and have a median income of $78,000. While 77% of Indian-Americans over 25 have at least a college degree, only 34% of Vietnamese-Americans do. Only 65% of Indian-Americans are U.S. citizens; among Vietnamese-Americans it¡¯s 85%. According to Pew, the GOP has the support of only 29% of Indian-Americans, compared with 51% of Vietnamese-Americans, the only right-leaning major Asian-American community.

But these political affiliations are fluid. In 1996, a plurality of Asian-American voters preferred Bob Dole to Bill Clinton. Asian-Americans have already begun to move toward the GOP, says Mr. Teixeira. One big reason: ¡°Democrats have embraced cultural radicalism that is not congenial to Asian voters.¡± In short, the activist left¡¯s extreme positions on merit-based admissions to schools, law and order, and gender and sexuality create an opportunity for the GOP.

Either way, Asian-American voting preferences have national political implications. Asian-Americans are the fastest-growing ethnic grouping in the country. Between 2000 and 2023 their numbers nearly doubled, from 11.9 million to more than 23 million. They now make up 7% of the population and 5.6% of eligible voters. The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that by 2060 the Asian-American population will swell to 36.8 million, or 9.1% of the population.

If Asian-Americans solidify behind the Democrats, the party is likely to dominate presidential elections, turn purple states like Georgia and Virginia reliably blue, and even shade Texas purple. If Asian-Americans turn toward the GOP instead, or split their loyalties more evenly than they do currently, it would ensure a more competitive electoral landscape and a healthier two-party system.

Why do so many Asian-Americans lean left? Education probably explains some of it. In general, college-educated voters tend to prefer the Democratic Party, and 54% of Asian-Americans over 25 have at least a college degree, compared with only 33% of all Americans. Geography may play a role too. Most Asian-Americans live in solidly blue states. About 30% live in California alone.

The majority of Asian-Americans disagree with the GOP on gun control and abortion, and many have come to view it as an anti-immigrant party. Overall, few Asian-Americans seem to share the distrust of big government that has long animated the conservative movement. And with the demise of communism¡¯s global potency, many Korean- and Vietnamese-Americans no longer have a strong reason to vote GOP. As a 2021 research paper co-authored by a Pew computer scientist put it, these days the main ¡°political differences within the Asian American community are between those who are progressive and those who are even more so.¡±

Such certainty about Asian-American attitudes is misplaced. Like most people, Asians care a lot about the economy. More particularly, extreme activist positions on so-called equity in school admissions, criminal justice, and transgenderism either directly hurt Asian-Americans or violate some of their most deeply held beliefs.

In 2020 Asian-American voters moved toward Donald Trump by 7 points compared with four years earlier. That year two Korean-American women in Orange County flipped House seats from blue to red, in part by vocally opposing socialism. Glenn Youngkin in Virginia attracted Asian voters alarmed by progressives¡¯ moves to scrap merit-based testing for admission to selective public schools. Asians helped turf out soft-on-crime Democrats such as Chicago¡¯s Mayor Lori Lightfoot and San Francisco¡¯s District Attorney Chesa Boudin. For many, alarmist left-wing rhetoric about ¡°white supremacy¡± and ¡°anti-Asian hate¡± is at odds with their everyday experience of urban crime.

¡°It should not surprise us that the Democratic hold on Asian-Americans is declining,¡± Mr. Teixeira says. ¡°What¡¯s surprising is that it isn¡¯t a bigger shift.¡±

For decades, Texas Republicans have worked to improve their party¡¯s standing in South Texas, a heavily Hispanic region where voters?despite being religious, patriotic, entrepreneurial and pro-family?routinely come out by big margins for Democrats. The GOP theory is that every additional Republican vote there is worth two because it takes away a reliably Democratic one.

Though the GOP has been generally satisfied with its labors, the party has often remained deeply underwater in South Texas even when it has swept the state. Now that¡¯s changing and in no small part thanks to Democratic policies, particularly on the border, economy and energy.

South Texas¡¯s rightward shift has national attention. After the 2020 election, the cited Zapata County as an example of how the region is getting redder. In this rural county along the Rio Grande, Mitt Romney lost by 43 points in 2012. Donald Trump lost by 33 in 2016. In 2020, he won by 5.

The trend continued into 2022, when Monica de la Cruz flipped the 15th Congressional District, becoming the first Republican in the seat since its creation in 1903. Hispanic Republicans also now hold three state House seats in South Texas, including the first GOP member from the Lower Rio Grande Valley, a Latina.

So what made South Texas start shifting so much? There have been plenty of theories, but now there¡¯s a data-driven answer. Ragnar Research gave the question an in-depth look in a recent poll sponsored by the Associated Republicans of Texas, a conservative group involved in state legislative races; Project Red TX, which works to elect Republicans to local offices; and Texans for Responsible Government, a political-action committee started by Michael and Mary Porter, California transplants and retired investors.

The survey was conducted Dec. 18-20?long enough after the midterms to be largely uninfluenced by postelection coverage, but close enough that people remembered how they voted and felt. It was also solidly constructed. A thousand voters were surveyed in a region extending from the Rio Grande Valley to San Antonio (excluding the predominantly white sections of four counties), then further west to Laredo and the Big Bend. The sample was 58% Hispanic, 32% non-Hispanic white and 10% other.

The poll found that the two parties have roughly equally favorable reputations: 48% of South Texans view the GOP favorably and 44% unfavorably, compared with 47% and 46%, respectively, for the Democrats. That¡¯s a big improvement for Republicans from years past.

The GOP advantage was possible only because 42% of Tejanos (Texas Hispanics) now view the party favorably versus 49% unfavorably. They still view the Democratic Party favorably overall but only by 57% to 36%?a much smaller advantage than it once held.

The survey found South Texans like Republicans because of their focus on border security, conservative values and competent governing. Those who dislike the party cite Donald Trump and their view that the party is uncaring and untruthful. By contrast, South Texans liked Democrats for supporting abortion rights and gun control, but disliked them for ignoring the border crisis, raising taxes, and failing on jobs and the economy.

When asked for the top reason they voted for the GOP, 40% said ¡°immigration and border security,¡± 21% said they liked the Republican candidate better, and 17% said ¡°jobs and the economy.¡± Among Democratic voters, 31% said the main reason was abortion, 17% liked the candidate better, and 13% said ¡°getting guns off the streets.¡±

Immigration was the top issue for the region¡¯s Hispanics. That¡¯s understandable. Local social services strain under the record number of desperate people crossing the border. Their hospitals pay for uncompensated care for illegal aliens. Their communities deal with the petty crime. Many South Texans have friends or family in law enforcement or border patrol. By ignoring border security, Democrats are driving Tejanos toward the GOP.

Jobs and the economy were the second most important issue for Hispanics. That¡¯s not solely because of inflation. South Texas is oil and gas country. Workers in the energy industry know Democrats want to kill their high-paying jobs.

Looking toward the 2024 presidential race, 43% of South Texans preferred a generic Republican, 45% a Democrat. If that holds up next year, it would mean a GOP landslide statewide. But it matters who Republicans nominate. Mr. Trump trails South Texas to President Biden, 43% to 49%, while Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis leads 47% to Mr. Biden¡¯s 43%.

Policies have consequences. In South Texas, the national Democratic agenda is creating a new generation of Tejano Republicans. Bien hecho.

A Memphis panel voted to return Democratic former state Rep. Justin Pearson to the legislature, less than a week after he and another Democratic lawmaker were expelled by Tennessee¡¯s Republican-led House of Representatives.

GOP leaders in the chamber removed Mr. Pearson and fellow Democrat Justin Jones on Thursday, a rare punishment for speaking out of turn on the House floor following last month¡¯s mass shooting at a Nashville school. Republicans, who hold a 75-23 majority in the House, failed to get the two-thirds majority needed to expel their colleague Rep. Gloria Johnson. Democrats and gun-control advocates have rallied around the lawmakers, dubbing them the Tennessee Three.

The Democratic-controlled Shelby County Board of Commissioners, in a special meeting Wednesday afternoon, appointed Mr. Pearson in an interim capacity until a special election can be held. The vote was unanimous, 7-0. On Monday, Nashville officials voted?also unanimously?to return Mr. Jones to the Tennessee House; he was sworn in shortly afterward.

Mr. Pearson said on social media that he would be sworn in Thursday morning, and that he was organizing buses to take supporters from Memphis to Nashville, the state capital. Shelby County Commissioner Mickell Lowery, the board¡¯s chairman, said he would work quickly to finalize paperwork to make the appointment official. ¡°We need to get that to Nashville as soon as possible,¡± Mr. Lowery said.

A spokesman for Tennessee House Speaker Cameron Sexton previously said he planned to seat whomever was chosen by local officials.

Mr. Pearson is a 28-year-old environmental activist and had taken office earlier this year. He walked to the meeting Wednesday with supporters gathered around him. After the vote, he thanked the commissioners for voting to reinstate him.

¡°Nashville thought they could silence democracy,¡± Mr. Pearson said. He added that, when he got back to the state house, he would double-down on pushing for tighter gun restrictions. ¡°What we have shown here in Memphis¡¦is that we do not speak alone. We speak together. We fight together.¡±

He ended his speech to sustained applause, shouting: ¡°Let¡¯s get back to work!¡±

Speaking on the Breakfast Club radio show Tuesday, Mr. Pearson said he was expelled despite being sent to the state house by voters. ¡°We got a problem going on in Tennessee,¡± he said, adding later: ¡°If you continue to erode democracy, you will reach a point when you will not have it.¡±

Republicans moved to expel the three Democrats for ¡°disorderly behavior¡± after they interrupted a House session on March 30. GOP members said the trio had broken rules about preserving order and displaying political messages following a school shooting that left six dead. A 28-year-old suspect killed three students and three adults at a private Christian school in Nashville on March 27; police killed the shooter at the scene.

Ms. Johnson joined the protest on the House floor, chanting messages such as ¡°No action, no peace,¡± but she said she didn¡¯t raise her voice or use a bullhorn to speak. Ms. Johnson is white and Messrs. Jones and Pearson are Black, setting off allegations of racism by some Democrats. Republicans have denied that claim.

The day Messrs. Jones and Pearson were expelled, House Republicans said in a tweet: ¡°It¡¯s never been about change. Their only interest is being in the spotlight.¡±

Thousands of protesters marching on the state Capitol have been pressuring Tennessee Republican leaders to make it harder to buy guns following the state¡¯s most high-profile mass shooting in years. The shooter had legally obtained the guns used at the school and fired more than 100 rounds in roughly 15 minutes, authorities said.

A federal appeals court on Tuesday weakened a federal law prohibiting firearm possession by individuals convicted of serious crimes, ruling that a Pennsylvania man convicted of food-stamp fraud has a constitutional right to arm himself.

The ruling by the Philadelphia-based Third U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed an earlier decision upholding a lifetime gun ban against the man. It marked the first time since the Supreme Court expanded Second Amendment rights last year that a U.S. appeals court held that people convicted of fraud and other nonviolent crimes don¡¯t automatically lose their constitutional right to bear arms.

The plaintiff in the case, Bryan David Range, pleaded guilty in 1995 to concealing his income to obtain about $2,500 in food stamps. Other than that offense, he has had a clean criminal history apart from minor traffic, parking and fishing infractions, his lawyers said. He served no time behind bars, but because the food-stamp offense carried a maximum punishment of five years of imprisonment, it permanently disqualified him from possessing firearms under a decades-old federal law.

Range argued in a lawsuit supported by gun-rights advocates that the lifetime ban violated his rights, preventing him from buying a deer-hunting rifle and a shotgun to defend himself. The Third Circuit, rehearing the case with an expanded roster of judges participating, agreed with him. The court in a divided ruling said the federal government failed to show the ban was consistent with Founding-era treatment of people convicted of such nonviolent offenses.

¡°We hold that the Government has not shown that the Nation¡¯s historical tradition of firearms regulation supports depriving Range of his Second Amendment right to possess a firearm,¡± Judge Thomas Hardiman wrote. ¡°Range remains one of ¡®the people¡¯ protected by the Second Amendment.¡±

Other judges in a concurring opinion said the ruling speaks to Range¡¯s situation and doesn¡¯t suggest that murderers, thieves, sex offenders, domestic abusers and other violent criminals have gun rights.

Several dissenting judges said the decision runs counter to the Supreme Court¡¯s prior suggestions that the felon gun ban is presumptively lawful.

Nearly a year ago the Supreme Court in New York State Rifle and Pistol Association v. Bruen recognized a Second Amendment right to arm oneself outside the home for self-defense, striking down New York¡¯s strict licensing rules for carrying concealed handguns in public.

In doing so, the conservative-led bench fundamentally changed how lower courts are supposed to decide if gun restrictions are constitutional.

Before the Bruen decision, lower courts had often balanced the rights of gun owners against the public-safety objectives of a challenged law. The Supreme Court rejected that approach and directed judges to focus instead on whether a gun law comports with the nation¡¯s tradition of firearm regulations. It put the burden on the government to show that a modern-day gun law is similar to how states restricted firearms in the late 1700s or 1800s.

The ruling reinvigorated challenges to a range of gun laws, including provisions of the federal Gun Control Act of 1968, the law that makes it illegal for certain classes of people to possess firearms. Judges have also clashed on whether alleged domestic abusers, drug users and gun owners under felony indictment have gun rights.

One question left unanswered by the Supreme Court is whether the Second Amendment covers people who have broken laws but aren¡¯t necessarily dangerous.

The appeals court rejected the U.S. Department of Justice¡¯s argument that only law-abiding, responsible citizens are protected by the Second Amendment. Judge Hardiman said that standard was too vague and loose, and if taken to an extreme, could support the disarmament of Americans with traffic tickets.

The government likened the gun ban against Range to Founding-era state laws disarming British loyalists and other categories of people who were distrusted. It also pointed to early American laws that made certain nonviolent crimes, like horse thievery, punishable by death. The appeals court said the comparisons were too stretched.

A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment.

¡°Mr. Range has been vindicated after this very lengthy legal fight,¡± said one of his attorneys, Michael Gottlieb.",WSJ
https://www.wsj.com/articles/bruen-transforms-the-gun-debate-thomas-second-amendment-restrictions-text-history-b50104f6?mod=Searchresults_pos5&page=4,2023-07-02,Bruen Transforms the Gun Debate,"The case established a constitutional right to carry pistols in public for self-defense.

The range had a faint smell of crisped paper. ¡°Stand like you¡¯re going to throw a punch. Lean forward. Line up the sights,¡± the instructor told me. ¡°The ¡®A¡¯ in AK-47 doesn¡¯t stand for accuracy. OK, let it fly.¡± I was in Las Vegas to meet with Chuck Michel, a leading lawyer for Second Amendment advocacy groups and an old high-school friend. What happens in Vegas . . . is because machine gun ranges can¡¯t be found in my home state, California.

I¡¯m not a gun guy?though I¡¯ve hunted with an Ithaca shotgun and even shot a .357 Magnum?but I respect the Second Amendment right to own a firearm. Still, I¡¯m horrified and saddened by every mass shooting that lights up national headlines. Other shootings are rarely mentioned, like the 29 shot, eight fatally, in Chicago on the last weekend of June. And most other weekends.

Next up was a belt-fed gas-operated M240 Bravo machine gun. ¡°This is what Biden left behind in Afghanistan,¡± the instructor noted. Finally, he handed me a semiautomatic AR-15, often called an ¡°assault weapon.¡± Mr. Michel explained, ¡°Pistols with magazines are also semiautomatic. AR-15s are labeled assault weapons because of scary cosmetic features, a muzzle brake or flash suppressor or a collapsible stock, even though ARs have similar stopping power as many other firearms.¡± It was very slow shooting compared with the machine guns, though I still don¡¯t understand why you would want to own one.

Well, because gun rights are individual rights. In District of Columbia v. Heller (2008), the Supreme Court upheld gun ownership for self-defense in the home. New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen (2022) upheld the right to carry pistols outside the home for self-defense, striking down ¡°may-issue¡± licensing systems that required a ¡°proper cause¡± or ¡°special need¡± to carry firearms.

Now all states must allow open or concealed carry?¡°shall-issue¡± licensing. I don¡¯t care if you love guns or hate guns; this is the new reality for individual rights. ¡°This was a hard reset,¡± Mr. Michel says. ¡°Gun laws passed pre-Bruen are all subject to relitigation. It¡¯s legal vs. policy.¡±

It also guarantees full employment for gun-advocacy lawyers. ¡°Since Bruen, gun-reform groups, often funded by Bloomberg and Soros, are going state to state to pass laws with restrictions on people, places and gun types.¡± Mr. Michel says. But there is now a Bruen test, as written in the ruling, to ¡°assess whether modern firearms regulations are consistent with the Second Amendment¡¯s text and historical understanding.¡± Mr. Michel sums the test up: ¡°Was there anything in existence in 1791 that would indicate the founders would have tolerated these kinds of laws or restrictions?¡±

As far as restrictions on gun types, you may be thinking there were no magazines or machine guns in 1791. But guns were more advanced than many assume?innovations like Kentucky Long Rifles helped win the Revolutionary War. Mr. Michel says some courts have suggested drawing a line between automatic and semiautomatic. He thinks that restrictions on common-use semiautomatic firearms don¡¯t pass the Bruen test. We¡¯ll see.

Bruen does note historic gun restrictions for ¡°sensitive places¡± like government buildings but it specifically says you can¡¯t declare the entire island of Manhattan a sensitive place. I was surprised at Mr. Michel¡¯s answer when I asked about the old line ¡°Guns don¡¯t kill people, people kill people.¡± He said many gun advocates aren¡¯t opposed to mental-health screenings, but other restrictions, such as restraining orders, should allow for individual due process. Gun reformers should exploit this, and even strengthen the FBI¡¯s National Instant Criminal Background Check System.

I asked Mr. Michel how to stop mass shootings in schools and elsewhere. ¡°What law are you going to pass to stop someone? Gun-free zones? They don¡¯t work. Gun bans? Same.¡± Chicago¡¯s strict gun ordinances obviously don¡¯t help its gun-crime problem.

Mr. Michel says, ¡°States with more-liberal carry laws have lower gun violence.¡± I¡¯ve seen studies both ways. ¡°Here¡¯s why. Maybe 5% of citizens get carry licenses. No one would go duck hunting if 5% of the ducks could shoot back.¡± Good gun owners deter bad ones. We saw this in the 2020 Texas church shooting, stopped short by a lawful gun-carrying citizen.

I asked why the left has such an intense focus on gun control. He answered, ¡°They want to wipe out gun ownership in a generation. There¡¯s a growing movement to reshape society by restricting individual freedoms.¡± No kidding. DEI. ESG. Defund the police. Woke cancelings. Mr. Michel notes, ¡°Guns are the last obstacle to social engineering.¡± Food for thought.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom, perhaps knowing he¡¯ll lose gun arguments in courts, has quixotically proposed a constitutional amendment with gun restrictions. Post-Bruen, that¡¯s probably the only way to do it. Until then, I suspect sensible laws that screen buyers, rather than places or gun types, have the best chance to be effective. ",WSJ

Democrats know how to beat Donald Trump, which is why they privately hope he never exits the political stage. It¡¯s Republicans who can¡¯t figure out how to deal with the former president. Fortunately for the GOP, Georgia might offer some clues.

No one will be surprised if control of the U.S. Senate is determined by the race between incumbent Democrat Raphael Warnock, who won the seat in a 2021 special-election runoff, and his Republican challenger, Herschel Walker, the former University of Georgia football star. That¡¯s one reason the contest has received outsize coverage in the media.

But Republicans should also pay close attention to the governor¡¯s race between Republican incumbent Brian Kemp and Stacey Abrams, the voting-rights activist and progressive darling. Mr. Kemp¡¯s lead has been significant and steady, and if he prevails on Election Day his campaign could serve as a road map for other Republicans hoping to escape Mr. Trump¡¯s shadow without turning off Trump supporters.

In the Senate race, Mr. Walker¡¯s inexperience, personal foibles and questionable fitness for office have dominated press coverage. Many Republican officials in the state anticipated as much, which is why Mr. Walker wasn¡¯t their first choice. He was Mr. Trump¡¯s choice, and Mr. Trump got his way. Absent Mr. Trump¡¯s urging, Mr. Walker, who has known Mr. Trump since the 1980s, almost certainly wouldn¡¯t have sought the nomination.

What¡¯s received less attention is that Mr. Warnock has run a smart campaign aimed at swing voters. He¡¯s done that partly by running away from a voting record that shows near-lockstep support for President Biden, who is deeply unpopular in the state. The senator has also jettisoned much of the progressive playbook being used by many fellow Democrats running for office this year.

¡°Across the country, most Democratic candidates have hung their electoral fortunes on the threat to abortion rights,¡± McClatchy columnist David Catanese wrote last week. A notable exception is Mr. Warnock. ¡°In more than a dozen TV ads the first-term Democratic senator has run over the past year, none has mentioned reproductive rights. His campaign doesn¡¯t harp on the right to choose in its press releases or relentlessly highlight the impact of the Dobbs Supreme Court decision,¡± he added. It¡¯s ¡°an intentional strategic omission¡± designed to avoid alienating the black churchgoers who are ¡°an integral piece of Warnock¡¯s fragile coalition that hold complex and evolving views on whether and when it¡¯s morally acceptable to end a pregnancy.¡±

Mr. Warnock¡¯s wisest move might be that he hasn¡¯t spent much time campaigning with Ms. Abrams, whose race against Mr. Kemp is a rematch of the 2018 gubernatorial contest. Ms. Abrams has elevated issues such as abortion, gun control and supposed threats to black voting rights. She has supported defunding the police and regularly draws attention to her race and sex, as she did in her televised debate on Tuesday with Mr. Kemp. Still, she¡¯s expected to lose again, by more than she did last time, and her support among blacks has declined from four years ago. Meanwhile, Mr. Kemp¡¯s share of the black vote is expected to increase and could exceed what Mr. Walker receives in his Senate race.

Mr. Kemp¡¯s focus on economic growth and his efforts to reopen the state in the early days of the pandemic seems to be resonating. The governor has never trailed in the race and currently holds a 5-point lead, based on the RealClearPolitics polling average. Mr. Kemp¡¯s campaign performance thus far is even more impressive because he faced such strong Trump headwinds. In 2020 Mr. Kemp resisted pressure from Mr. Trump to overturn the Georgia election results after Mr. Biden narrowly won the state. In response, Mr. Trump tried to end Mr. Kemp¡¯s political career.

Mr. Trump recruited former Sen. David Perdue to challenge Mr. Kemp in a primary earlier this year. The former president then campaigned for Mr. Perdue and used his political organizations to fund television ads attacking Mr. Kemp. Nevertheless, the governor won the primary with 74% of the vote, exposing the limits of Mr. Trump¡¯s grievance politics and his hold on the party¡¯s base. Mr. Trump has made a spectacle of his disagreements with Mr. Kemp?going so far as to say he wants Ms. Abrams to win?but the governor hasn¡¯t responded in kind. Instead, Mr. Kemp has avoided publicly criticizing the former president and largely ignored him. The upshot is that Mr. Kemp enjoys the support of some 95% of Republicans in the state. Other Republican politicians might take note.

What works in Georgia won¡¯t work everywhere, but some variation of Mr. Kemp¡¯s strategy is worth pursuing if Republicans hope to reach a post-Trump era anytime soon. Exercising more self-control than Mr. Trump can go a long way toward marginalizing him without alienating his supporters.",WSJ

Government shouldn¡¯t operate like that, but it too often does, sometimes to evade the Constitution¡¯s limits on its power. A recent decision by the Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the practice and provided a road map for officials to circumvent the First Amendment¡¯s protection for freedom of speech.

Maria Vullo led the New York State Department of Financial Services, which has broad power to regulate almost every major financial player in the U.S. After the February 2018 school shooting in Parkland, Fla., Ms. Vullo and then-Gov. Andrew Cuomo issued a press release stating that the department would ¡°urge¡± the insurers, banks and companies it regulates ¡°to review any relationships they may have with the National Rifle Association¡± for ¡°reputational risk.¡±

The goal was to punish the NRA for its gun-rights advocacy. The press release quoted Ms. Vullo as saying that corporations need to ¡°lead the way¡± on ¡°positive social change . . . to minimize the chance¡± of future shootings. ¡°DFS urges all insurance companies and banks doing business in New York to join the companies that have already discontinued their arrangements with the NRA.¡±

Ms. Vullo followed through with official guidance to regulated entities. Citing ¡°the social backlash against the National Rifle Association¡± and society¡¯s ¡°responsibility to act,¡± the guidance directed insurers and banks to evaluate the ¡°reputational risks¡± of ¡°dealings with the NRA or similar gun promotion organizations.¡±

Behind the scenes, Ms. Vullo was pressuring senior executives of the insurance syndicate Lloyd¡¯s of London. In 2017 she had launched an investigation of insurers that formed partnerships with the NRA to sell ¡°affinity¡± insurance, including gun-owner policies. The basis was twofold: technical violations of disclosure rules and alleged violation of state law by covering losses, including criminal-defense costs, even when policyholders were found to have illegally discharged their weapons.

The NRA alleges in a lawsuit that, in a meeting with Lloyd¡¯s, Ms. Vullo acknowledged that these problems were widespread in the marketplace but made clear that her focus was the NRA policies. The key to minimizing liability, she emphasized, was joining the department¡¯s efforts to combat the availability of firearms by weakening the NRA.

Lloyd¡¯s got the message. Despite its reputation for insuring even the most controversial risks, it understood that its regulator considered working with one of the nation¡¯s most broadly supported advocacy organizations to be off-limits. Lloyd¡¯s publicly announced that it was terminating all business with the NRA. It signed a consent decree with DFS permanently barring it from participating in any insurance program with the NRA?rather than the usual remedy of bringing policies into compliance and possibly paying a fine. The decree didn¡¯t cover the non-NRA policies that ran afoul of the same New York laws. The NRA says its corporate insurer refused to renew its policy because it feared similar reprisals after seeing DFS target Lloyd¡¯s and another NRA-affinity insurer.

In Bantam Books v. Sullivan (1963), officials from the Rhode Island Commission to Encourage Morality in Youth sent letters to booksellers informing them that it had identified certain books and magazines as ¡°objectionable¡± and noting its power to recommend obscenity prosecutions. The U.S. Supreme Court held that this ¡°informal censorship¡± violated the First Amendment. Although the government didn¡¯t seize or ban any books, it ¡°deliberately set about to achieve the suppression¡± of protected speech.

So did Ms. Vullo. As the Second Circuit observed, she ¡°plainly favored gun control over gun promotion¡± and therefore ¡°sought to convince DFS-regulated entitles to sever business relationships with gun promotion groups.¡± Yet the judges concluded that was reasonable.

Their logic is circular: The NRA¡¯s advocacy led to a ¡°backlash¡± that could ¡°affect the New York financial markets,¡± given that ¡°a business¡¯s response to social issues can directly affect its financial stability in this age of enhanced corporate social responsibility.¡± So Ms. Vullo¡¯s entreaties to drop the NRA weren¡¯t threats, but actions ¡°to protect DFS-regulated entities and New York residents from financial harm and to preserve stability in the state¡¯s financial system.¡±

It¡¯s fanciful to suggest that selling insurance to, or in partnership with, the NRA poses a threat to New York¡¯s financial system. More important, the Constitution¡¯s protections don¡¯t amount to much if government officials can censor disfavored opinions simply by labeling them ¡°reputational risk.¡± And even if such risk is real, empowering government officials to engage in censorship on that basis creates a heckler¡¯s veto over controversial speech: Gin up enough online outrage or disagreement by officials or purported experts, and you can justify censoring anything or anyone.

The Biden White House successfully pressed Twitter to shut down accounts, including journalist Alex Berenson¡¯s, for bucking the expert consensus on Covid vaccines. The FBI and Twitter cooperated in 2020 to censor humorous tweets about the election and voting. The Cato Institute¡¯s Will Duffield has identified 62 recent instances of government officials making specific demands to censor speech on social-media platforms. This kind of ¡°jawboning¡± by government officials usually occurs in the shadows and rarely comes to light. It can be difficult to identify when official encouragement crosses the line into coercion.

The Supreme Court will have to take up the question sooner or later, and an NRA appeal would present a strong opportunity to do so. The DFS has broad discretionary power to regulate industries on which almost everybody depends. That makes it all the more crucial to ensure that it respects the Constitution.

NASHVILLE, Tenn.?The suspect in last week¡¯s mass shooting in Nashville, Tenn., fired more than 100 rounds in roughly 15 minutes and spent months plotting the attack, killing six at a private Christian school, authorities said.

Journals and other writings left by the suspect, identified by police as 28-year-old Audrey Hale of Nashville, also indicated Hale acted alone, the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department said Monday. 

Investigators continue to search for a motive for the attack, in which the suspect killed three students and three adults at Covenant School in the Green Hills neighborhood of Nashville. Hale?who allegedly carried two military-style, semiautomatic rifles and a handgun to the school?fired a total of 152 rounds, police said Monday. Some 126 were rifle rounds; the other 26 were from the handgun.

Police identified the victims as Evelyn Dieckhaus, William Kinney and Hallie Scruggs, daughter of the Covenant Presbyterian Church¡¯s lead pastor, all age 9. Also killed were three adults: Cynthia Peak, 61, a substitute teacher; Katherine Koonce, 60, the head of school; and Mike Hill, 61, a custodian at the school, according to police.

The latest developments came as Gov. Bill Lee, a Republican, said he would support reviewing the state¡¯s gun laws after facing pressure to act. Thousands of demonstrators, mostly students from Nashville schools and universities, marched to the state Capitol building and legislative offices downtown on Monday morning.

¡°We cannot control evil but we can do something,¡± Mr. Lee said Monday in the first news conference he has held since the shooting. Mr. Lee and other leadership in the Republican-dominated Tennessee legislature have focused on pushing school security measures in response but have been resistant to calls for the pre-emptive gun control laws Democrats and others have called for. 

Mr. Lee stopped short of saying he supported ¡°red-flag laws,¡± which would allow authorities to take away guns from people that a court deems dangerous, in part because of terminology.

¡°I¡¯m looking for answers that separate dangerous people from firearms and protect constitutional rights. It is very important that we do that, whatever it¡¯s called,¡± he said from government offices near the state Capitol. ¡°I¡¯m standing here saying that that¡¯s what we should do, going forward with that in mind. That certainly requires more than a week.¡±

Mr. Lee was joined by nearly three dozen Republican state lawmakers and at least two Democrats during Monday afternoon¡¯s news conference. The governor said he would bolster school security legislation that was already pending with more funding for physical security upgrades and other measures, such as expanding school mental and behavioral health liaison resources.

Lt. Gov. Randy McNally, the state Senate president, sent a letter to Mr. Lee last week calling for armed guards at all schools, securing windows and glass doors in schools, magnetic locks on doors and other measures. He also told reporters that he would support red-flag laws, given adequate protection against false reporting, although he was unsure the rest of Republican leadership agreed.

Mr. Lee told reporters he had not spoken to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Sen. Todd Gardenhire, who last week said he wouldn¡¯t consider gun laws this session, when asked if action would be delayed by the impending end of the legislative term. ¡°I think we will work really hard to accomplish that,¡± Mr. Lee said.

Hale recently obtained seven guns through legal means, including the three recovered at the shooting scene, John Drake, chief of the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department said last week. Police interviewed Hale¡¯s parents, who haven¡¯t spoken publicly about the shooting. They believed Hale had sold a previously owned firearm, and they were unaware of the additional purchases, Mr. Drake said, adding that the suspect had been under a doctor¡¯s care for an emotional disorder. Police said they hadn¡¯t been made aware of any reason to seize the firearms from the suspect¡¯s home before the shooting.

At the Capitol, many of the students who showed up Monday wore red, a school color of the Covenant School, and held signs calling for stricter gun laws or asking ¡°Am I next?¡± The demonstration followed a similarly-sized march held last Thursday at the capitol. 

Demonstrators who went through security and entered the House chambers gallery last week were supported in chants on a megaphone by three Democratic lawmakers. The three were removed from committee assignments Monday and could face further repercussions for disrupting the floor session, House Speaker Cameron Sexton told reporters Monday.",WSJ

WASHINGTON?President Biden and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell touted a bridge project made possible under the 2021 infrastructure bill during a trip to Kentucky on Wednesday, offering a show of bipartisanship as Washington lurches into a contentious era of divided government. 

The former Senate colleagues appeared together in Covington, Ky., where the White House announced funding to upgrade the Brent Spence Bridge between Ohio and Kentucky, as well as investments in other bridges around the country. Also scheduled to attend were Sen. Sherrod Brown (D., Ohio), Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, former Sen. Rob Portman (R., Ohio) and Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, a Democrat. 

Mr. Biden called Mr. McConnell a ¡°friend and colleague¡± and cited the bipartisan infrastructure law as an example of elected officials in Washington working together. 

¡°It wasn¡¯t easy to get this done,¡± Mr. Biden said, addressing Mr. McConnell. ¡°It wouldn¡¯t have happened without your hand. And I want to thank you for that. We have to find common ground to get major legislation done.¡±

In joining Mr. Biden, Mr. McConnell was implicitly endorsing both bipartisanship and certain kinds of government spending, both of which have fallen out of favor among a rising breed of Republicans, especially in the House. Only 13 House Republicans voted for the bipartisan infrastructure bill; of those, more than half didn¡¯t return to Congress. 

Mr. McConnell was one of 19 Senate Republicans who backed the bill. On Tuesday he marked a personal milestone, becoming the longest-serving leader in the Senate. He surpassed the previous longest-serving leader, Sen. Mike Mansfield (D., Mont.), who was Senate majority leader from 1961 to 1977 and was known for his low-key style and ability to find consensus. 

On Wednesday, Mr. McConnell described the bridge funding as a ¡°legislative miracle.¡±

¡°It¡¯s the government working together to solve a major problem at a time when the country needs to see examples like this of coming together and getting an outcome,¡± he said. 

The two men¡¯s display of unity in Kentucky comes as Republicans in Washington scrap over the future leadership of the House of Representatives. Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.), fell short in his bid to become speaker during the first three rounds of voting Tuesday, underscoring the divisions within his party. 

Many conservatives say party leaders, including Messrs. McConnell and McCarthy, have been too quick to cut deals with Democrats. Some are pushing to use the coming need to raise the debt ceiling to pressure Democrats to agree to spending cuts, a tactic Democrats call irresponsible.

The infrastructure law includes $40 billion for bridges. The White House planned to announce $2 billion in spending around the country on Wednesday, with more than $1 billion dedicated to the Brent Spence Bridge.

The funds will go to upgrading the existing bridge, as well as building a new bridge dedicated to interstate drivers, the White House said. The current bridge lacks a safety shoulder and frequently is backed up, prompting traffic delays and some accidents along what is a major commercial corridor.

¡°It¡¯s a harrowing experience,¡± said Mr. Portman, who wrote the portion of the infrastructure law that is providing the bulk of the funding awarded for the Brent Spence Bridge. His work to redo the bridge spanned roughly three decades, starting with obtaining federal money for environmental reviews, permits and design work, he said.

The Transportation Department has announced $1.64 billion for the Brent Spence Bridge project, as part of the programs created under the infrastructure law. The project is getting half of all the money going to bridge projects under the law in this fiscal year, according to the Eno Center for Transportation, a nonpartisan Washington think tank.

The money for the bridge is shaping up as one of the largest sets of federal grants to finance a bridge in U.S. history, if not the largest, the think tank said. Work had been held up for years because of rising costs and opposition from Northern Kentucky, which covers the Cincinnati suburbs, to financing the project through tolls, lawmakers said. The grant money will obviate the need for tolls, according to Mr. Portman.

During the past two years, Mr. Biden achieved a number of bipartisan pieces of legislation while Democrats had narrow control of both chambers of Congress, including gun-control legislation and measures to boost the semiconductor industry. But passing major new legislation will be challenging in the new Congress. Republicans take the majority in the House this week, while Democrats maintain control of the Senate. 

House Republicans are expected to push for spending cuts and policy changes, as well as launch investigations into Biden administration cabinet officials and into Mr. Biden¡¯s son, Hunter Biden. The two parties will have to reach agreement to lift the debt ceiling or to fund the federal government during the next two years.

While Mr. Biden has a longstanding relationship with Mr. McConnell he only briefly overlapped in Congress with Mr. McCarthy, and his White House has limited relationships with many House Republicans. 

White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Tuesday that Mr. Biden is still ¡°willing to work with Republicans who are willing to continue to deliver for the American people.¡± ",WSJ

Montana¡¯s House of Representatives voted to bar a transgender Democratic lawmaker from participating in debate from the legislature floor a week after she spoke out against a bill that would ban gender-affirming therapies for minors.

The Republican-controlled legislature on Wednesday voted 68-32 along party lines to no longer admit Zooey Zephyr to the House floor for the rest of the session. She will be able to vote remotely.

Republican Rep. Sue Vinton, the House Majority Leader who introduced the motion, said Ms. Zephyr had encouraged disruption of the session and didn¡¯t comply when told to come to order and clear the floor by the House Speaker.

Last week, Ms. Zephyr told colleagues they would ¡°have blood on their hands¡± if they voted for a bill banning gender-affirming surgeries and treatments for minors in the state. The 34-year-old became the state¡¯s first openly transgender woman elected to the legislature when she won the 2022 vote for Montana¡¯s 100th House District, which includes parts of Missoula. 

The bill blocks doctors from providing various medical treatments, including prescribing puberty blockers or hormone therapies and conducting surgeries that would ¡°treat minors with gender dysphoria.¡± The legislation, which has gone to Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte¡¯s desk after it was passed by the House, also prohibits use of public funds, programs and employees for the medical and surgical procedures.

Since she made the comments, Ms. Zephyr has said she has been denied the opportunity to speak in the legislature. People were arrested on Monday while protesting on her behalf. 

House Speaker Matt Regier, a Republican, said all representatives were free to participate in debate while following House rules. ¡°The choice to not follow House rules is one that Rep. Zephyr has made,¡± he said in a statement posted on Twitter Tuesday.

Before the vote Wednesday, Ms. Zephyr said she was standing up for the LGBT community.

¡°When the speaker asks me to apologize on behalf of decorum, what he¡¯s really asking me to do is be silent when my community is facing bills that get us killed,¡± she said. ¡°He is asking me to be complicit in this legislature¡¯s eradication of our community. And I refuse to do so.¡±

Rep. Vinton urged her colleagues to support the motion, saying the Democrat¡¯s conduct shouldn¡¯t be allowed. 

¡°Our constituents and our state deserve better. They deserve our full attention, and this institution and body deserve the respect of all its members,¡± Ms. Vinton said. ¡°However, it has not been respected. And we must regain the decorum of this body?not only now, but also to set precedent for the future.¡±

The vote was condemned by the ACLU and by the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBT lobbying and advocacy group. ¡°The protection of free and open debate is central to our democracy,¡± said Human Rights Campaign President Kelley Robinson. ¡°This action is part of a deeply disturbing trend of legislatures punishing leaders for using their voices to protest against discriminatory and dangerous legislation.¡±

State legislative sessions across the U.S. have been punctuated by tensions and debates this year as lawmakers grapple with hot-button social issues from transgender rights to abortion access to gun rights. 

In Tennessee earlier this month, the Republican-led House of Representatives expelled two Democratic lawmakers for ¡°disorderly behavior¡± after they one other colleague interrupted a session for several minutes to call on Republicans to act on gun control following a mass shooting at a Nashville school. 

Memphis and Nashville officials later voted unanimously to return the two Black lawmakers, Justin Pearson and Justin Jones, to the legislature until a special election can be held. 

Restricting transgender healthcare has been a focus in many statehouses. Republican-led legislatures in Georgia, Tennessee and South Dakota have passed bills banning certain gender-affirming therapies and surgeries for children and teenagers with or without parental consent, saying they can be harmful. 

Lawmakers opposing the bills say the bans are dangerous. The American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics, among other medical organizations, support access to gender-affirming care. 

In Nebraska, Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh filibustered on the floor of the state¡¯s legislature for much of the session as a form of protest against legislation that would ban gender-affirming surgeries and treatment for transgender Nebraskans under age 19.",WSJ

The two parties are building out their agendas in the midst of a reshuffling of power in several states. Democrats flipped the state Senate in Minnesota and both legislative chambers in Michigan, meaning members of the party will have full control of government because the states have Democratic governors. Democrats won control of the Pennsylvania House, further dividing government in that state, while gaining control of the governorships in Arizona, Maryland and Massachusetts.

Republicans next year will hold the governorship in 26 states compared with 24 states for Democrats. More than half the nation¡¯s population will live in states with Democratic governors, said North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, chair of the Democratic Governors Association. Before the elections, there were 28 Republican governors and 22 Democrats in office. There have been more Republican governors since 2011, and the number of Democratic governors was 16 as recently as 2018, according to the National Governors Association.

Recent wins helped Democrats chip away at Republicans¡¯ significant advantage?which the GOP retains?when it comes to control over state government around the U.S. The GOP this year flipped one governorship, in Nevada, breaking up Democrats¡¯ grip on a state where that party maintained control of both legislative chambers.

Heading into the 2024 elections, Democrats said they hope these incremental gains will help them push policies that will become harder to achieve in Washington. After the midterm elections, Republicans are set to take control of the House of Representatives, dividing power at the federal level. State-level Democrats are aiming to pass measures on such polarizing topics as abortion, which faced obstacles under divided state governments.

¡°You¡¯ll also see us focus on things that have been ignored over the last few years or have been under attack,¡± said Winnie Brinks, the incoming majority leader of Michigan¡¯s state Senate.

Voters there re-elected Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, and approved a ballot measure that enshrined reproductive rights in the state constitution. Democrats will have full control of Michigan¡¯s state government for the first time since 1984.

Legislative leaders said they plan to repeal a largely dormant 1931 state abortion ban and add protections for LGBT people to the state¡¯s civil-rights law. Other priorities include boosting infrastructure spending and passing new legislation regarding storage requirements for firearms, Ms. Brinks said.

Groups backing Democrats spent more money on state legislative races this cycle than those boosting the Republicans. The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee spent $50 million on races compared with $30 million for the Republican State Leadership Committee, spokespersons said. A Democratic group known as the States Project spent another $60 million, according to Daniel Squadron, a founding partner of the organization and a former New York legislator.

Republicans still hold a significant lead in veto-proof majorities, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. This lead significantly limits Democrats¡¯ ability to influence legislation in such states as Florida and Ohio.

¡°Republicans defied the odds on Tuesday night by facing down an onslaught in national liberal spending and an incredibly challenging political environment to still preserve their hold on an overwhelming majority of state legislatures throughout the country,¡± Republican State Leadership Committee President Dee Duncan wrote in a postelection memo.

Minnesota Democrats plan to pass a bill that would put access to abortions into statute, solidifying access currently protected by a state Supreme Court decision, said Melissa Hortman, the current house speaker and member of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party. She said other priorities include enacting a paid family-leave measure and new gun legislation, while noting previously failed efforts to pass a red-flag law. Such a measure generally allows authorities to remove guns temporarily from people threatening violence.

¡°The trifecta is a total game-changer for the people of Minnesota,¡± Ms. Hortman said regarding the party¡¯s control of both legislative chambers and the governor¡¯s office.

Trying to improve the student-to-counselor ratio in schools and broaden children¡¯s access to mental-health services are also priorities, said incoming Senate Majority Leader Kari Dziedzic. With a slim, one-vote majority in the Senate, Democrats will have little margin for error. They will need to work on getting details right before determining what potential bills might look like on such matters as firearms legislation, Ms. Dziedzic said.

For Republicans, improving school grades and public safety and lowering tax bills for families are all goals, said Republican Sen. Mark Johnson, who is shifting to the role of minority leader after leading the GOP majority. ¡°I hope that¡¯s the same priorities that the Democrats have.¡±

Republicans broke a Democratic trifecta in Nevada when Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo defeated Gov. Steve Sisolak?the only incumbent governor to lose re-election this year. In a victory speech last week, Mr. Lombardo promised to expand school choice, increase public safety and reopen government offices that were closed during the pandemic.

¡°I will insist on meeting on common ground, armed with new ideas and driven by discipline to succeed,¡± Mr. Lombardo said. A campaign spokesperson didn¡¯t return messages seeking comment.

Steve Yeager, the top Democrat in the Nevada Assembly, said in an interview, ¡°People in Nevada want solutions to these problems, and I¡¯m hopeful we can work together.¡±",WSJ

Almost every sheriff in Illinois has vowed not to enforce a new ban on military-style semiautomatic weapons, posing a challenge to Gov. J.B. Pritzker, who championed the law in the wake of a July 4 mass shooting by a gunman wielding an AR-15-style rifle.

The protest appears to be more widespread than moves by sheriffs in several other states that have passed restrictive new gun laws in recent years. The Illinois sheriffs assert their objections to the law on Second Amendment grounds but say their refusal to enforce the measure applies only to cases where individuals aren¡¯t accused of another crime.

The law also faces lawsuits in federal and state courts challenging its constitutionality, with two citing a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision that struck down New York¡¯s system of registering concealed-carry weapons.

Mr. Pritzker, a Democrat, has said he is confident that the new ban will pass constitutional muster and called the sheriffs¡¯ moves political grandstanding that comes at the expense of public safety.

All but a handful of the state¡¯s 102 county sheriffs have signed a nearly identical statement decrying the law and saying they won¡¯t enforce its provisions in the absence of other crimes.

DuPage County Sheriff James Mendrick said he was barraged by citizen questions about the law, which bans the sale, manufacture and possession of the weapons. Existing owners can keep their weapons but must register them with the state by the end of this year.

¡°Just the way it was put out, it made our citizens believe that this is the first step to basically taking everybody¡¯s gun, you know, start with rifles, move to handguns,¡± said Mr. Mendrick, a Republican, whose county is the state¡¯s second-largest with more than 900,000 residents. 

He said he issued a statement last week to try to allay those concerns. ¡°Neither myself nor my office will be checking to ensure that lawful gun owners register their weapons with the State, nor will we be arresting or housing law abiding individuals that have been charged solely with non-compliance of this Act,¡± said the statement, which Mr. Mendrick said was based on a template from the Illinois Sheriffs¡¯ Association. 

A spokesman for Mr. Pritzker called the concerns about searches a red herring. ¡°Local sheriffs won¡¯t be asked to go door to door in search of those who haven¡¯t complied,¡± said Alex Gough, senior deputy press secretary for the governor. ¡°What they are expected to do is enforce the law in the course of their regular law-enforcement activities that often require checks on the firearm status of those accused of crimes.¡± Mr. Gough also pointed out that city and state police will also be involved in enforcing the law and that criminal penalties attached to the law are a misdemeanor on the first occurrence and a felony on the second.

Tom Dart, sheriff of Cook County, the state¡¯s largest with more than five million residents, is among the supporters of the new law. 

The office of Mr. Dart, who is a Democrat, said in a statement that other sheriffs are getting ahead of themselves. ¡°It is premature to speculate about enforcement action when law enforcement?including Sheriffs¡¯ Offices?are awaiting direction from the State Police on how to enforce the new law, let alone whether the state will devote the necessary resources to enable them to do so,¡± it said.

In addition to banning what the law calls assault weapons, including AK- and AR-type models, the law also bans high-capacity magazines and switches that convert semiautomatic weapons to fire at a higher rate than that for which they were designed.  

Eight other states and the District of Columbia have similar bans on the sale and possession of the weapons, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Five of those states also require that owners of existing assault-style weapons register them with the state, it says.

On Tuesday, lawyers for the Illinois State Rifle Association filed a federal lawsuit arguing the ban violates the ¡°fundamental and individual right to keep and bear common arms.¡± Recent high-court rulings, it says, would allow such a ban only in cases where the prohibited firearms are both unusual and dangerous.

¡°Arms that are in common use cannot be unusual or dangerous,¡± the lawsuit argues. 

A state judge in Effingham County in southeastern Illinois held a hearing Wednesday on a state lawsuit that seeks an injunction against the law on grounds that the manner in which it was passed violated the state constitution. The judge said he planned to rule on the motion by 4 p.m. Friday, according to court records.

The Illinois Sheriffs¡¯ Association said in a statement last week that it was ¡°extremely disappointed in the passage and enactment of HB 5471, that further regulates and limits the purchase of a variety of weapons for lawful gun owners.¡± The statement said sheriffs are very concerned about rising violence and welcome any tools that would address the problem but that the assault-style weapons ban wouldn¡¯t do so.

Jim Kaitschuk, executive director of the Illinois Sheriffs¡¯ Association, didn¡¯t respond to requests for comment.

Mr. Pritzker drew headlines last week when he seemed to threaten to fire sheriffs who didn¡¯t enforce the new law. ¡°The reality is that the State Police is responsible for enforcement, as are all law enforcement all across this state, and they will in fact do their job or they won¡¯t be in their job,¡± he said.

Mr. Gough, the spokesman, said the governor was saying that the voters would decide on the fate of the sheriffs.

¡°Sheriffs have a constitutional duty to uphold the laws of the state, not pick and choose which laws they support and when. These sheriffs will have to answer for their records on public safety to the voters,¡± Mr. Gough said in a statement. ",WSJ

WASHINGTON?Medicaid is at the center of a widening partisan divide among states over transgender healthcare, where some Americans are denied access to gender-related treatments while others are seeing the availability of such care expand. 

The Medicaid insurance program, which covers more than 90 million low-income or disabled Americans, has become a way for states to signal sharply divergent positions on transgender-specific care. Republican-led states including Mississippi and Tennessee, where the GOP controls both legislative chambers and the governorship, have recently introduced legislation to restrict some coverage for care of gender-transitioning patients.

States led by Democrats, such as Washington, California or Colorado, defend Medicaid coverage of what supporters call gender-affirming care: treatment based on a patient¡¯s self-identified gender regardless of the sex on the birth certificate. Maryland lawmakers in March even voted to expand treatments to include therapies such as voice modification surgery and fertility preservation services. 

¡°We are seeing states that are hostile to it become more hostile and states that are supportive are becoming more so,¡± said Christy Mallory, legal director at the University of California Los Angeles¡¯ Williams Institute, a research center focused on gender-identity law and politics. ¡°There¡¯s a real polarization.¡± 

Transgender rights are among a slew of hot-button issues driving states in opposite directions. Legislatures have long focused on local issues, such as minimum-wage levels or environmental concerns, but state politics are increasingly caught up in the culture-war issues dominating chat rooms, social media and national cable-news programs. 

Abortion, immigration, gun control, race theory: A state¡¯s approach to any of these issues is increasingly determined by national partisan interests. ¡°On almost every measure, on social issues and the role of government, there is a widening gap,¡± said Robert Blendon, an emeritus public health professor at Harvard University.

Washington has a say in how Medicaid is dispersed. States administer the program but it is partially funded by federal tax money, and under federal regulation Medicaid can¡¯t provide benefits to one group of people while not providing such benefits to other beneficiaries. The upshot is litigation. 

In one of many examples, the Fourth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is weighing a lawsuit over West Virginia¡¯s Medicaid program because it won¡¯t pay for some gender-affirming surgeries, including hysterectomies to treat those who no longer identify as female. West Virginia allows its Medicaid administrators to cover the procedure for other medical reasons. 

¡°It seems now to be playing out in the courts,¡± said Usha Ranji, associate director for women¡¯s health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation. 

Medicaid was never meant to be a partisan policy tool. The 1965 law creating the program was intended to provide health coverage to society¡¯s most vulnerable. The Obama administration added funding to the program in exchange for states expanding care for the uninsured poor. Today, more than a quarter of Americans rely on the program for insurance coverage.   

The newest proposals to restrict transgender care are part of a broader conservative offensive targeting transgender rights in the U.S. that have led to bans on gender-affirming treatment for minors, limits on the discussion of gender identity in schools and prohibitions on transgender students competing on school sports teams that align with their identified gender. Transgender rights have become a GOP campaign issue ahead of the 2024 elections. 

Some lawmakers are focused on minors. Mississippi Republican Gov. Tate Reeves on Feb. 28 signed legislation that includes a prohibition on Medicaid reimbursing or covering gender-transition procedures for people under 18. The state¡¯s Medicaid director on Feb. 15 also sent a letter to insurers saying ¡°available evidence demonstrates these treatments cause irreversible physical changes and side effects that can affect long-term health.¡±

Mr. Reeves and the state Medicaid agency didn¡¯t return emails seeking comment.

Some states are also looking at restricting coverage for adults. The Missouri state Senate passed legislation March 23 that would ban the state¡¯s Medicaid program from paying for gender-affirming treatment for adults, restricting payments for gender-transition-related surgeries, hormones or puberty blockers. A state House version approved this month would also restrict the coverage in Medicaid. ¡°Public money should not be spent on these procedures,¡± said GOP state Sen. Mike Moon.

At least nine states prohibit Medicaid coverage of transgender-related healthcare for all ages and two states ban the coverage for minors, according to the Movement Advancement Project, a nonprofit that supports LGBT rights. Twenty-six states explicitly cover transgender-related healthcare. Others have no explicit policy.

¡°They¡¯re really trying to restrict care for youth and adults,¡± said Logan Casey, a senior policy researcher and adviser with the Movement Advancement Project. ¡°Very well coordinated and funded far-right extremists are trying to prevent trans people from being trans.¡±

The state Medicaid initiatives could have a significant effect on access to coverage for transgender people. About 1.4 million adults in the U.S. identify as transgender and approximately 152,000 of them are enrolled in Medicaid, according to Williams Institute statistics. 

Sixty-seven percent of states¡¯ Medicaid programs included gender-affirming hormone therapy and 49% included gender-affirming genital surgery as covered benefits, according to a February 2021 survey and report published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine.

Lawmakers pushing the Medicaid restrictions say taxpayers shouldn¡¯t foot the bill for procedures that they say are elective and harmful. Transgender advocates and medical groups say the bills are discriminatory, and that the treatment can be lifesaving and science is settled.

The American Medical Association has said that ¡°gender-affirming care is medically necessary, evidence-based care that improves the physical and mental health of transgender and gender-diverse people.¡± 

Medical industries in some other countries?including Britain, Norway, Sweden, France and Finland?are moving away from using hormones and puberty blockers for minors, saying the approach is ¡°experimental¡± given insufficient medical evidence of the benefits outweighing the risks. ",WSJ

Michigan State University police, students and staff all tried to grapple with the same question after Monday night¡¯s mass shooting on campus: Why would a man who never attended or worked at the school attack students there, killing three and injuring five?

Michigan State University officials on Tuesday morning identified the gunman as Anthony Dwayne McRae, saying he was a 43-year-old with no known connection to the school.

Officials said they didn¡¯t know Mr. McRae¡¯s motive. The five injured students, who haven¡¯t been identified, remained in critical condition on Tuesday, officials said.

The MSU police identified the dead students as Brian Fraser, a sophomore from Grosse Pointe, Mich., Arielle Anderson, a junior also from Grosse Pointe, and Alexandria Verner, a junior from Clawson, Mich.

Mr. McRae opened fire in Berkey Hall, an academic building, shortly before 8:30 p.m., according to MSU Deputy Police Chief Chris Rozman. Mr. McRae killed two students there, he said. Then Mr. McRae walked less than a block to the MSU Union building, a student gathering place, where he fatally shot one other student. Police didn¡¯t specify the locations for the students who were wounded. Mr. McRae fled after carrying out the shootings.

Students on the East Lansing campus and people in the area sheltered in place for around four hours as hundreds of law-enforcement officers searched for the gunman. Police cars and helicopters swarmed the area and the sprawling 5,200-acre campus in East Lansing, a city about 75 miles northwest of Detroit.

Some of the roughly 50,000 students listened to police scanner feeds, hoping to get hints about where the gunman might be as they texted updates to their loved ones.

Police released a surveillance photo of the suspect, and a Lansing resident recognized Mr. McRae and gave police information that allowed them to find him. Mr. McRae shot himself after police made contact with him, Deputy Chief Rozman said at a press conference late Monday night.

Authorities said they had no idea why Mr. McRae came to the campus and opened fire. He appeared to have no connection to the university, officials said. Deputy Chief Rozman said officials executed a search warrant at a residence connected to Mr. McRae.

Authorities recovered at least one weapon used in the shooting, but police didn¡¯t provide details on the weapon.

In 2019, Mr. McRae was arrested for possessing a handgun he legally owned, but for which he had no conceal carry permit, and was initially charged with a felony. He eventually pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of carrying a loaded firearm in a vehicle, a misdemeanor, for which he served 12 months of probation, according to Ingham County, Mich., Prosecutor John Dewane.

The police in Ewing, N.J., said Tuesday that the Michigan authorities found a note in Mr. McRae¡¯s pocket in which he made threatening statements about two schools in Ewing. The police said he had local ties to the township. All of Ewing¡¯s public schools were closed on Tuesday, but police later said there was no threat to the schools there.

A neighbor of Mr. McRae¡¯s said she had never spoken to him but remembered one incident from last summer when neighbors called police because shots were being fired from the house in Lansing where he lived with his father.

The neighbor, Megan Bender, said police spoke to Mr. McRae after neighbors heard him firing a weapon several times toward the yard from the back of the red-frame house with ¡°No Parking¡± and ¡°Beware of Dog¡± signs on the front gate. It wasn¡¯t immediately clear whether any charges were filed after the incident last year. The Lansing Police Department declined to comment.

¡°I couldn¡¯t believe it,¡± Ms. Bender said of hearing about the shooting. ¡°I don¡¯t have words. You can¡¯t make sense of anything like that. It just doesn¡¯t make sense.¡±

Gov. Gretchen Whitmer spoke with President Biden on Monday night, she said at a Tuesday morning press conference on the MSU campus. The governor, a Democrat, and Mr. Biden have advocated for tougher gun laws and both have recently said they would push for legislative changes.

¡°We know this is a uniquely American problem,¡± she said of the mass shooting. ¡°We cannot keep living like this.¡±

Ms. Whitmer and Rep. Elissa Slotkin, whose district includes MSU, both reiterated calls on Tuesday for more gun control. The Democrats cited other shootings like the one in December 2021 at a high school in Oxford, Mich., in which four students were killed and seven other people were injured.

¡°We have children in Michigan who are living through their second school shooting in under a year and a half,¡± Ms. Slotkin said at the press conference at MSU. ¡°If this is not a wake-up call to do something, I don¡¯t know what is.¡±

The MSU shooting came one day before the five year anniversary of the school shooting in Parkland, Fla. Seventeen people died at a high school in the city, making it one of the deadliest U.S. school shootings.

MSU officials said Tuesday that classes were canceled for the rest of the week. Multiple school districts in the area, including in Lansing and East Lansing, canceled classes on Tuesday, to give students time to process the shooting. ",WSJ

Portland, Ore.

Masked antifa gangsters, armed with crowbars, smashed their way through Portland¡¯s Bison Coffeehouse¡¯s windows on Oct. 5. The vandals were angry that the owner, Loretta Guzman, was planning to hold a ¡°Coffee With a Cop¡± event?an opportunity for residents to chat with officers patrolling their neighborhood. That Ms. Guzman is a Native American who approaches her business with a slightly mystical Portlandian leftism bought her no sympathy from the radicals. ¡°First off, my bison, the artwork,¡± were blasted with paint, she said. ¡°Then the tables and benches and my work area, everything.¡± She adds, ¡°Right now a lot of people are scared. Other people supported me, other small businesses, but they don¡¯t want me to say anything . . . because they¡¯re afraid of the backlash.¡±

Ms. Guzman¡¯s situation may help explain the strange race to become Oregon¡¯s next governor. The Beaver State is reliably Democratic. It hasn¡¯t voted for a Republican governor since 1982, or for president since 1984. In 2020, Joe Biden defeated Donald Trump here by 16 points. But now the left in Oregon is eating its own, giving Republican Christine Drazan a shot at defeating Democratic nominee Tina Kotek. The RealClearPolitics poll average has Ms. Drazan in the lead, 37% to 34%, with independent candidate Betsy Johnson picking up 16%. All three women are former state legislators.

In an Oct. 10 interview at her Portland office, festooned with old campaign buttons and large framed pictures of the likes of Bill Clinton, Ms. Kotek, 56, was careful not to speak ill of the far left. The closest she came was insisting that radicals don¡¯t care for her because she¡¯s a moderate: ¡°I definitely think that if you talk to folks who are more on the political left, that I¡¯m probably too mainstream.¡± An aide at a Kotek campaign event, asking not to be identified, agreed with this assessment. Oregon progressives will vote for Ms. Kotek, he said, only because she would do the ¡°least worse¡± as governor. Pantsuited with close-cropped hair, Ms. Kotek tags her Republican opponents for ¡°extreme views¡± that are ¡°not aligned with where Oregonians want their state to be.¡±

Ms. Kotek¡¯s inability to condemn the far left puts her at a disadvantage in a race focused almost exclusively on crime. Portland, more than three times the size of Oregon¡¯s second-largest city, is in the middle of a well-documented crime wave. Federal Bureau of Investigation data show that violent crime in 2021 spiked 38% from the year before, far outpacing the national trend. The city¡¯s homicide rate has risen 207% since 2019. Homelessness and drug use make things worse: Portland has an estimated 5,200 people on the streets, and since voters passed Measure 110, a 2020 state initiative decriminalizing personal possession of hard drugs, Oregon has seen overdose deaths increase by 20%.

Ms. Kotek gives no convincing answers to questions about crime, defaulting to talk about gun control and drug treatment. But during her own interview, Ms. Drazan, 50, wouldn¡¯t let the issue go. ¡°I did a ride-along with the East precinct,¡± she said. ¡°The stack of calls they had to respond to was massive. And some of them were very, very serious calls.¡± The police were so overwhelmed, she noted, that it sometimes took them as long as 90 minutes to respond. Crime is ¡°out of control in Portland,¡± she said, and the only cure is to stop coddling leftist extremists. With styled hair and makeup, Ms. Drazan presents herself as a suburban mom, concerned most of all with safety.

The independent, Ms. Johnson, 71, agrees with Ms. Drazan that the key issue is crime. ¡°You¡¯re taking your life in your own hands to walk downtown.¡± Once a prominent Democratic figure in the state Legislature, the eccentric Ms. Johnson is the spoiler in the governor¡¯s race, although no one is certain which campaign she will spoil. Ms. Johnson has raised $16 million, more than either major-party nominee, much of it from founder Phil Knight (who has recently begun supporting Ms. Drazan as well).

Ms. Johnson¡¯s signature look is oversized orange glasses, reaching down her cheeks and above her eyebrows. A framed poster in her downtown office is of the ¡°bat signal,¡± used by Gotham City to call for Batman¡¯s help, only instead of a stylized bat it¡¯s in the shape of Ms. Johnson¡¯s glasses. ¡°There are only two candidates in this race that represent change,¡± Ms. Johnson said. ¡°I think my change is more synchronous with the citizens of Oregon than what Ms. Drazan is offering.¡± Ms. Johnson tries to position herself as socially liberal and fiscally conservative. She served on the board of Planned Parenthood and calls herself ¡°very pro-choice.¡± Nonetheless, she said, ¡°People are hungry for a change. Tina Kotek represents the status quo.¡±

The war of the left on the left may bring Oregon its first Republican governor since the 1980s. A typical skirmish occurred at an Oct. 12 online town hall, with a Portland police official and members of the city¡¯s Democrat-dominated Independent Police Review appearing helpless as far-left activists screamed obscenities at them and accused them of white supremacy, misogyny and capitalism.

President Biden visited Portland over the weekend, perhaps in recognition of the peril Democrats face in Oregon. He ate ice cream at a Baskin-Robbins and touted his record at a fundraiser for Ms. Kotek. ¡°We should be funding police more, not less,¡± he said. On Twitter, antifa-linked accounts mused about infiltrating his hotel.

It isn¡¯t clear how Mr. Biden¡¯s stumping for the Democrats helps the likes of Ms. Guzman at the Bison Coffeehouse or any other Oregonian affected by the city¡¯s disorder. Two people were shot in Portland while the president was en route to the city. No arrests were made, and no suspects have been reported.",WSJ

The gunman who killed five of his co-workers and wounded eight others at a Louisville, Ky., bank Monday legally purchased the AR-15 rifle six days before the mass shooting, police said Tuesday. 

Interim Louisville Metro Police Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel said the suspect, 25-year-old bank employee Connor Sturgeon, bought the weapon at a local dealer on April 4. 

Officers completed a search warrant at his residence and recovered some items, said Chief Gwinn-Villaroel, without elaborating. She declined to provide details about a possible motive or any red flags. 

¡°The investigation is ongoing,¡± she said.

The suspected shooter opened fire Monday morning at Old National Bank in downtown Louisville. Police fatally shot the gunman, who live-streamed the killings, after they exchanged gunfire at the scene.

Those killed include bank employees Joshua Barrick, 40 years old, Deana Eckert, 57, Thomas Elliott, 63, Juliana Farmer, 45, and James Tutt, 64. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said Mr. Elliott, who was active in local politics, was one of his closest friends. Ms. Eckert died Monday evening, hours after the shooting, police said.

Three patients remained at UofL Hospital in downtown Louisville Tuesday afternoon, according to a spokeswoman for UofL Health, the health system that includes UofL Hospital. The hospital said one of the patients who was in critical condition has since improved. Two patients were discharged Tuesday. Three others had been discharged a day prior. 

Officer Nickolas Wilt, a 26-year-old who recently graduated from the police academy, remained in critical condition in the intensive-care unit Tuesday after he was shot in the head while responding to the shooting, said Jason Smith, chief medical officer at UofL Health.

Police said the shooter waited in the lobby of the bank to ambush officers as they arrived. 

¡°As soon as he saw them he shot at them,¡± Deputy Police Chief Paul Humphrey said at a press conference Tuesday, where police showed newly released body-camera footage of the confrontation. Officer Wilt, who is in critical condition, was shot as he ran up the steps of the bank building toward the shooter¡¯s ambush.  

Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said the city would hold an interfaith vigil Wednesday evening. Several churches in the city held vigils for the victims Monday evening. 

Mark Lechner was good friends with Mr. Tutt, one of the five bank employees killed in Monday¡¯s mass shooting. Mr. Lechner and his wife vacationed in Greece with Mr. Tutt and his wife last October. The two couples were supposed to go out together to a dinner theater this coming Friday.

Mr. Tutt and his wife had four grown children, said Mr. Lechner, who is co-principal of a local development firm.

¡°He was just the nicest man, he would do anything for you,¡± Mr. Lechner said.

He had also grown friendly with Mr. Barrick, another victim of Monday¡¯s attack. Mr. Barrick leaves behind his wife and two young children. Their church, Holy Trinity Catholic Church in Louisville, held a vigil for the family Monday evening.

¡°Our hearts are heavy, they are broken, and we are searching for answers,¡± Pastor Shayne Duvall said on the parish page.

Jim Ryan, chief executive of Old National Bank, a unit of holding company Old National Bancorp, and other leaders at the bank traveled to Louisville Monday to support victims¡¯ families and others affected by the shooting. 

¡°There are no words to adequately describe the sadness and devastation that our Old National family is experiencing as we grieve the tragic loss of our team members and pray for the recovery of all those who were injured,¡± Mr. Ryan said in a statement Monday evening.

The mostly Midwestern regional bank is based in Evansville, Ind. It had nearly 4,000 employees at the end of 2022, according to a regulatory filing.

The mass shooting spurred calls for action on gun control from leaders and lawmakers, including President Biden. The tragedy in Louisville came two weeks after a heavily armed shooter killed three children and three adults at a private Christian school in Nashville, Tenn.

There have been 146 mass shootings since the start of 2023, according to the Gun Violence Archive. The nonprofit research group defines mass shootings as any incident in which four or more people, not including the shooter, are wounded or killed. The data include gang-related shootings and workplace incidents.

Mr. Greenberg, who narrowly escaped a shooting at his campaign office in February 2022, said 40 people in Louisville have died as a result of gun violence so far this year. He said the city has been working on longer-term solutions to end gun violence, including investing more in mental-health care, but needed state and federal lawmakers to take more immediate action.

Kentucky law allows eligible adults ages 21 and over to carry a concealed weapon without a license.

¡°We have to take action now,¡± Mr. Greenberg said. ¡°We need short-term action to end this gun violence epidemic now, so fewer people die on our streets, and in our banks, and in our schools, and in our churches.¡±",WSJ

I think we all have a sense of where this is going.

People are alarmed at the cost of things. They are afraid of crime. They don¡¯t like what they see of the schools. These are personal, intimate issues. They have to do with how you live your life. You don¡¯t want to be the parents who can¡¯t buy the kids what they need and the other kids make fun of them. You don¡¯t want the emotional mood of your house dictated by your fear that you can¡¯t make rent. You don¡¯t want to be hit on the head on the way to the store?what would you do if you were carjacked, what¡¯s the right way to act??and you don¡¯t want to be constantly doubting your kids are safe. And the schools are swept by weirdness of all kinds. Just teach them math and history so they can go on and get a good job and not always be afraid of the rent.

These three things, plus illegal immigration, will defeat a lot of Democrats on Nov. 8, as will one other factor: The Democrats don¡¯t have a plan. This leaves voters thinking: We can¡¯t turn it around with them. Their party is committed to ideologies that are causing or contributing to these problems, and they¡¯re afraid to break free of those commitments because the leftward edges of their base won¡¯t vote for them if they do. So they¡¯re stuck talking doubletalk.

With the Republicans, maybe their plans will work, maybe not, but at least they¡¯re talking about what you¡¯re thinking about, at least there¡¯s a possibility they¡¯ll come through.

I want to talk about crime and New York. The other day this newspaper ran an editorial recalling some recent mayhem. A 62-year-old grandfather was punched in the head at a Bronx subway station and propelled onto the tracks. Last week a man was pushed onto the tracks in Brooklyn, and another onto the tracks in the Bronx. In September, a father of two was fatally stabbed on a Brooklyn train. The suspect was a homeless man who¡¯d been arrested for a subway stabbing last year and was out on ¡°supervised release.¡± As if we supervise them.

The New York Post reported an 18-year-old woman was stabbed in the hip on Wednesday by a ¡°deranged stranger¡± at 10 a.m. on a Brooklyn street. A police source told the Post: ¡°It looks like an EDP¡±?an emotionally disturbed person.

Democrats have long replied that crime statistics are in fact lower than they were decades ago. But decades ago New York was in a sustained crime wave and trying to crawl its way out. The trend lines now are going the wrong way. So when Democrats respond this way, it sounds like, ¡°Who you gonna believe, me or your lying eyes?¡±

Professional criminals and gang members know they have the upper hand: changes in procedure mean they likely won¡¯t be charged; revisions in bail law mean if they are, they¡¯ll be out by lunch.

And there are the mentally ill, who are pretty much dumped on the streets in America. Back in the 1960s and ¡¯70s the forces of modern thinking argued not only that mental hospitals were scandalously run and often Dickensian, but that we had it all wrong: Society itself is so crazy that a ¡°crazy¡± response was a hallmark of a kind of higher sanity. The insane were our thought leaders. It is true that institutionalization was usually terrible, but the answer can¡¯t be that the insane are left to roam the streets and build tent cities on sidewalks. The answer is to devote more resources to broadening and improving institutionalization. Most politicians know this but feel they can¡¯t turn the ship around, so they ignore the issue and just do press conferences where they say moving things about the little girl who was murdered.

Meanwhile, the mentally ill often go off their meds when they¡¯re in the mood. Manic depressives miss the high of the manic episodes, schizophrenics miss their visions. So they go off, and go crazy, and grandpa winds up on the subway tracks.

You can calculate what a street criminal will do, and factor it in. Don¡¯t walk on the empty street at night; don¡¯t wear the gold Rolex when dining at an outside restaurant, the scooter gangs will get you. It¡¯s harder to predict what an insane person will do, which is why everyone feels at their mercy.

People have no confidence?none?that ¡°the authorities¡± will do anything to make the situation better. The district attorneys¡¯ offices are in the grip of a legal ideology that views inequity and racism as the primary and essential problem, and once we solve them we can then focus on street crime.

This ideology owns Twitter, the Slack channels of major media companies and the departments of all major universities and their law schools. So it is formidable. It has been winning since the 2010s. But in sheer numbers its advocates punch way above their weight. What anticrime voters need to realize is they have mass. They are the overwhelming majority?in both parties. They can fight back. This Election Day I think they will.

That is the context of New York¡¯s startling gubernatorial race, with Republican Rep. Lee Zeldin up against incumbent Democrat Kathy Hochul. Ms. Hochul held a comfortable lead in a state where Democratic registration is twice that of Republicans, and Mr. Zeldin long ago wrapped himself around Donald Trump¡¯s engine and voted not to certify Joe Biden¡¯s 2020 electoral votes. This was in line with feeling in his district but not the state, which Mr. Trump lost by 23 points.

Yet suddenly it¡¯s a real race, and the reason is crime. In the debate this week, Mr. Zeldin talked about it as if he cared. When Ms. Hochul mentioned gun control, Mr. Zeldin lit up. No, he said, it¡¯s not only guns: ¡°You have people who are afraid of being pushed in front of oncoming subway cars, they¡¯re being stabbed, beaten to death on the street with hammers. Go talk to the Asian-American community and how it¡¯s impacted them with the loss of lives. . . . We need to be talking about all of these other crimes, but instead Kathy Hochul is too busy patting herself on the back, ¡®Job well done.¡¯ ¡±

He said he¡¯d declare a crime emergency from day one, as we did with Covid, and remove progressive district attorneys.

It was electric. Watch that race.

There was nothing endearing about Mr. Zeldin, who is deliberately growly and grim. He has this in common with a lot of the male post-Trump-presidency generation of GOP politicians: There is a sense of unease in them, something at once aggressive and furtive. They glower and simmer, grrr grrr, as if it¡¯s a concession to your fancy ideas of civilization to be personable. Here an angry conservative will say, ¡°Our country¡¯s a dumpster fire and you want charm? You want winsome?¡±

No, I¡¯d like normal. Politics is a game of addition. Attract those who don¡¯t equate a glower with wisdom. What does good nature cost you?

We should be able to conduct our lives without a constant air of menace. Our politics, also.",WSJ

Phil Murphy, a Democrat, approved a six-day season in December, reversing his position as animal-rights groups line up in opposition

There have always been bears around the tree farm that Dan Black¡®s family owns in Blairstown, N.J., but they haven¡¯t posed a problem until this year. Some amped-up ursids rampaged through rows of Christmas firs and broke branches and trunks of three dozen of them during this spring¡¯s mating season.

¡°It looked like a tornado came through when I first saw it,¡± Mr. Black, 63 years old, said. ¡°They have to control them somehow. They¡¯re not grizzly bears, they¡¯re just bears, but if you get in their way, they¡¯re going to go through you.¡±

New Jersey officials agreed. Citing an increase in the bear population and a rise in the number of bear-human interactions, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, reversed his position on allowing the killing of black bears in the Garden State. He signed an executive order this past Tuesday that will give hunters a six-day season next month.

¡°The facts on the ground have shown that we cannot rely on nonlethal methods alone to protect New Jersey residents from a growing black bear population,¡± he said.

Animal-rights groups erupted in opposition and said they are planning legal action. Bears can be effectively managed by nonlethal means, they said, and the killing of animals is unnecessarily cruel.

¡°We¡¯re not dealing with the issues of garbage and teaching people how to bear-proof their property,¡± said Jeff Tittel, a longtime environmental activist and former Sierra Club director.

The fierce debate that accompanied New Jersey¡¯s actions demonstrates the increasingly politicized nature of wildlife-management decisions?something experts expect will grow over time.

¡°When suburban sprawl moves closer to the mountains, because people want those mountain views, people are going to have conflicts,¡± said Paul Curtis, a professor of wildlife management at Cornell University. 

Bears around the country have ranged further out of the woods than usual this year because of dry conditions, said Carl Lackey, co-chair of the management committee for the International Association of Bear Research and Management. The result has been more bear-human conflicts.

In Idaho, officials earlier this month euthanized a mother grizzly bear and two cubs who had wandered out of Yellowstone National Park and resettled near Tetonia, showing ¡°little fear of people,¡± according to the state Department of Fish and Game. In Washington state, a woman was injured last month when a black bear attacked her as she let her dog out, according to the state¡¯s Department of Fish and Wildlife. That bear was also put down.

And in the northwest corner of New Jersey, a 34-year-old woman was attacked by a black bear in May as she was getting her mail, according to Sussex County Commissioner Dawn Fantasia. The area is the state¡¯s epicenter for bear encounters.

¡°There were bears that figured out how to unscrew the lids of bear-proof trash cans,¡± Ms. Fantasia said. Some hunting is happening illegally: On Tuesday, New Jersey conservation officers cited a 22-year-old man in connection with the shooting deaths of four bears near a state park.

The number of New Jersey bear incidents reported to the state in the first 10 months of 2022 more than tripled from the same period in 2021, according to the Department of Environmental Protection. That includes 62 aggressive encounters with humans, 12 dog attacks, 12 home entries, 15 attempted home entries, 89 instances of property damage and 52 attacks on protected livestock, Mr. Murphy said in an executive order reopening the hunt.

The state¡¯s bear population had dwindled to a handful in the 1970s but steadily recovered over about 30 years, leading state officials to authorize a hunt in 2003, according to Ed Markowski, a former employee of the state¡¯s Division of Fish and Wildlife. He now leads the New Jersey Outdoor Alliance, which represents hunters, trappers and fishers.

Regular hunts kept the bear population hovering around 1,500, Mr. Markowski said, but that changed during Mr. Murphy¡¯s tenure. The governor promised during his 2017 campaign to stop the bear hunt, and in 2018 he signed an executive order that prohibited hunting on state land. His administration declined to approve a new five-year bear management plan in 2021, effectively ending the hunt last year.

Since the 2018 order, the bear population has increased to more than 3,000, according to state officials and advocates. Black bears are far more numerous in Western states: officials in California estimate there are as many as 40,000.

¡°When you get so many bears that are able to breed and have cubs?and you have habitat out there that can sustain them?then you get explosions of the bear population,¡± said Mr. Markowski, who supports bringing back the hunt.

Susan Russell of the New Jersey Animal Protection League opposed the hunt and said the state needed to get serious about securing garbage, as is the case in Western states. Unlike the black bears in New Jersey, grizzly bears that are found in places such as Idaho are a federally protected species that can¡¯t be legally hunted.

Rich Beausoleil, a bear and cougar specialist for the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, said that while not perfect, managing trash and bird feeders are the most effective steps to avoiding bear-human conflict. Washington also holds an annual hunt that harvests around 10% of the state¡¯s black bear population?which is around 20,000, according to Mr. Beausoleil.

New Jersey state officials said that a wildlife-management plan launching along with the resumption of the hunt includes a pilot program for trash management.

Both proponents and opponents of the hunt said Mr. Murphy¡¯s bear policy has been primarily motivated by politics. The governor, who was re-elected last year in a tighter-than expected race, is seen as a potential 2024 presidential contender.

¡°Being for gun control and against hunting would hurt him with voters in New Hampshire and Iowa,¡± said Mr. Tittel, the environmental activist. ¡°He¡¯s sacrificing bears for his political ambitions.¡±

Bailey Lawrence, a spokesman for Mr. Murphy, said restarting the hunt was based on concrete evidence. ¡°Any assertions to the contrary diminish the tangible threats and challenging realities faced by impacted communities across the state,¡± he said.",WSJ

The contentious ouster of Tennessee state lawmakers Justin Jones of Nashville and Justin Pearson of Memphis is the latest skirmish in a longstanding power struggle between Republicans who control the state¡¯s politics and Democrats in charge of its fast-growing cities.

Now, after GOP legislators used their majority power to expel the two representatives last week, Democrats in the metro areas plan to use their authority to send them straight back, with Nashville-area officials voting Monday to return Mr. Jones to the Tennessee House of Representatives.

Republican state leaders in recent years have passed an array of measures that override local policies. A recent law, for example, cut the size of Nashville¡¯s Metropolitan Council from 40 to 20 members.

The city sued, arguing in part that there wasn¡¯t enough time to define the new council districts ahead of the August election. On Monday, a three-judge panel in a state court issued an injunction, blocking enforcement of the law while it continues to consider the city¡¯s suit. The Tennessee Attorney General¡¯s Office was reviewing the ruling on Monday evening, according to spokeswoman Elizabeth Lane.

Democratic city leaders have accused their state counterparts of trampling over the power of locally elected officials. Tennessee¡¯s GOP state leaders are primarily white, while many of the Democratic leaders of the cities and counties are Black.

Thursday¡¯s expulsion vote took Tennessee¡¯s schism to a new level, said Nathan Kelly, a professor of political science at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville.

¡°It was quite a power play on the part of Republicans. It¡¯s not something we¡¯ve seen before,¡± Mr. Kelly said. 

Tennessee is an extreme example of a polarized power dynamic playing out in many parts of the U.S. where red states contend with blue cities. In Texas, conservative state lawmakers have enacted laws pre-empting cities from passing prohibitions on fracking within city limits and other local policies that state leaders disagreed with. In Missouri, a former bellwether state that¡¯s been reliably red since 2016, Republican lawmakers and the state¡¯s GOP attorney general this year have pushed plans to oust St. Louis¡¯s top prosecutor, a Democrat.

Mr. Jones, who represents Nashville, could be reinstated by the city¡¯s Metropolitan Council on an interim basis until a special election can be held. The council will hold a special meeting Monday to fill the seat. Mr. Pearson represents parts of Memphis, where the Shelby County Board of Commissioners, with its Democratic majority, is set to vote for someone to fill his seat. 

Messrs. Jones and Pearson, who are Black, were accused of disorderly conduct along with a third Democrat, Gloria Johnson, who is white, for speaking out of turn on March 30. The ¡°Tennessee Three,¡± as their supporters have now dubbed them, interrupted a House session for several minutes to call on their Republican counterparts to act on gun control, after a mass shooter killed six people at a private Christian school in Nashville last month. 

Ms. Johnson, 60 years old, who represents part of Knoxville, kept her seat by one vote. Asked why she thought she wasn¡¯t expelled, Ms. Johnson replied, ¡°It might have something to do with the color of our skin.¡±

Cameron Sexton, speaker of the Tennessee House, didn¡¯t respond to requests for comment. House Republicans have said the three had broken rules about decorum and displaying political messages.  

The state hasn¡¯t always been in the grip of such a partisan divide. For more than a century until 2008, both parties had sizable representation in Tennessee, with Democrats often holding the majority, said Carrie Russell, a professor at Vanderbilt University who specializes in Southern politics. Many of its larger cities, particularly Memphis and Nashville, are historically Democratic.

Currently, Republicans hold 75 of the 99 seats in the state House, and 27 of the 33 seats in the state Senate, as well as the governor¡¯s office. 

Those supermajorities have allowed Republican state lawmakers to enact almost any legislation they want. They have moved to expand gun access in recent years and enact policies, opposed by some Democrats, promoting charter schools and tuition vouchers. The GOP has said the intent is to give students ways to opt out of failing schools.

Tennessee Republicans have used their power to redraw voter district maps on the federal and state level. The new maps took particular aim at deep-blue parts of Nashville. In Knoxville, which traditionally has voted Republican but had a recent influx of new voters who lean the other way, the redrawn map¡¯s lines put Ms. Johnson¡¯s home outside the district she was then representing. She had to move to a new district to be re-elected. 

Legislators also targeted Nashville¡¯s Metropolitan Council, which represents the city and surrounding county, with a law seeking to halve the number of members. The law, which Republicans said was aimed at improving governance in the region, was widely viewed as a reaction to the Council¡¯s decision not to pursue the possibility of hosting the Republican National Convention in 2024, Ms. Russell said. The Metropolitan Council has filed a lawsuit challenging the law. 

City and state leaders have also clashed over cultural issues, including how civil rights are protected, especially for LGBT people. When Tennessee legislators passed a law to strictly limit drag shows, a Memphis theater company filed a lawsuit challenging it. 

A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order on the ban on April 1. 

State Republicans also have passed legislation that would allow the state attorney general to ask a judge to replace local district attorneys on cases they refuse to prosecute. House hearings on the bill cited Nashville District Attorney Glenn Funk, a Democrat. Mr. Funk had previously said he wouldn¡¯t prosecute some low-level marijuana possession charges or enforce a state law requiring businesses to post signs if they let transgender people use public bathrooms associated with their gender identity. GOP legislators have said prosecutors shouldn¡¯t pick and choose which laws to enforce. 

While Tennessee¡¯s city-versus-state dynamic has been around for a while, Mr. Kelly said Thursday¡¯s expulsion signals an escalation in America¡¯s continuing political divide. 

¡°We¡¯ve been on a path toward greater ideological or partisan polarization for a long time,¡± he said. ¡°But what is really unique about a handful of states, including Tennessee, is the growing divide over the basic functioning of democracy.¡±

SOMERTON, Ariz.?A bipartisan group of senators is pushing ahead in the new Congress with efforts to reach an agreement on border security and immigration policy, after talks ran out of time last year.

The lawmakers recently visited the southern border in Arizona and Texas, in the face of sharp political divides over how to handle a record number of illegal crossings that have strained border staff and facilities. The lawmakers say they see an opening for compromise on an issue that has vexed Capitol Hill for decades, following last year¡¯s bipartisan work to pass a gun-control law.

¡°We¡¯re committed to finding lasting solutions to this crisis,¡± Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (I., Ariz.), who co-hosted the trip with Sen. John Cornyn (R., Texas), told reporters during a round table in Somerton, Ariz., last week. 

Ms. Sinema, who chairs the Homeland Security Committee¡¯s border management subcommittee, is pushing for a deal that combines a path to citizenship for about two million people who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children, known as Dreamers, in exchange for changes to how the asylum system at the border functions. It could also include expanding detention of asylum-seeking migrants and an extension of Title 42, a pandemic-era policy that allows illegal border crossers to be quickly turned back to Mexico. 

In December, Ms. Sinema and Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina came close to reaching a deal on a framework for an immigration package, which Ms. Sinema said they are now using as the starting point of the broader negotiations.

Mr. Cornyn, a key negotiator on the gun law, took heat from his party¡¯s right flank over those efforts. That law, among other things, put in place a requirement that background checks cover the juvenile and mental-health records of gun purchasers under 21 years of age.

¡°We have a track record of coming up with solutions in hard areas where others have said ¡®it¡¯s just too politically dangerous for me to take a stand,¡¯¡± said Mr. Cornyn at the round table event.

Natalie Yezbick, a spokeswoman for Mr. Cornyn, said Thursday that he doesn¡¯t support the Tillis-Sinema framework. She pointed to a comment in the Washington Post from December in which Mr. Cornyn said: ¡°I have said to them that I don¡¯t think there¡¯s any way we can pass immigration legislation without addressing the crisis at the border.¡±

Mr. Cornyn and Ms. Sinema worked closely on the gun law with several of the senators who attended the border trip, including Mr. Tillis and Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, who is also the chair of the appropriations subcommittee that deals with funding for the Department of Homeland Security. Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona and Democratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware, who joined the border group, were also involved in gun negotiations. 

¡°It¡¯s my hope that we¡¯re going to build on this and make some serious progress, but it¡¯s not going to be easy at all,¡± Mr. Coons said. 

Sens. James Lankford (R., Okla.), the top Republican on the border management subcommittee, and Jerry Moran (R., Kan.) also joined, rounding out the rare bipartisan border trip.

While senators have scored a string of bipartisan agreements related to guns, presidential election results, same-sex marriage and infrastructure, those laws were all passed with Democratic majorities in the House and Senate. Now, Republicans control the House, where GOP lawmakers are expected to be skeptical of any Senate legislation that goes beyond border security. 

¡°Under no circumstances are we going to play the failed, broken comprehensive immigration dance on all of the amnesty, we must do amnesty etc. etc. Let¡¯s go secure the border of the United States,¡± said Rep. Chip Roy (R., Texas). 

House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) has given no indication he will take up a comprehensive immigration package and has instead focused on border security.

When asked what Mr. McCarthy would need to see in a Senate agreement, spokesman Mark Bednar pointed to a tweet from December that said: ¡°Biden must enforce and defend Title 42, end catch-and-release, and restore Remain in Mexico. No amnesty.¡± 

The ¡°Remain in Mexico¡± policy started under former President Donald Trump required asylum seekers to wait in Mexico while their claims were processed. Amnesty is what some Republicans call a path to citizenship for immigrants in the country illegally.

Ms. Sinema continued to highlight immigration in a panel Tuesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.

¡°Unfortunately, Arizonans have suffered from the last 40 years of the federal government¡¯s failure to address this crisis. Which is why this is something that I¡¯ve been spending so much time and energy working on,¡± Ms. Sinema said Tuesday. 

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.), who was involved in bipartisan immigration negotiations a decade ago, said on MSNBC last week that he was ¡°encouraging efforts to deal with the border issue,¡± but said it is a ¡°long, hard road up.¡±

The last two years have seen record levels of illegal immigration at the border, with 2.2 million apprehensions made in the government¡¯s 2022 fiscal year. That has comprised both large numbers of migrants seeking asylum?many of whom the government was required to release into the U.S. to pursue their claim?as well as others seeking to evade capture so they can work in the U.S. illegally.

The Biden administration this month announced its broadest effort yet to curb illegal immigration, but the president in announcing the deal said Congress needs to enact a more comprehensive immigration plan.

The new administration policy uses several Trump-era immigration control measures to deny migrants a chance to win asylum after crossing the border illegally, including an expansion of Title 42. It also sets up a new program under which up to 30,000 would-be migrants a month can apply to fly to the U.S. legally, where they are given a two-year work permit and a chance to apply for permanent humanitarian protection.

Congress has made two recent efforts at comprehensive overhauls?one in 2006 championed by Republican President George W. Bush and another during Democratic President Barack Obama¡¯s administration in 2013. The latter effort resulted in a bill that would have tightened access to the border and overhauled the visa system. The Senate passed the bill with support of all Democrats and 14 Republicans before it stalled in the GOP-controlled House.

Since those failures, lawmakers have attempted to peel off smaller changes, such as updating the farm-visa program or creating a path to citizenship for Dreamers. But those more limited efforts have foundered in the face of bipartisan opposition, with Republicans wanting any immigration bills to contain more border restrictions and Democrats advocating more generous paths to citizenship for broader groups of people.

Douglas Nicholls, the Republican mayor of Yuma, Ariz., said the border trip made him more hopeful that something could be done. He cautioned, however: ¡°This is not an easy topic, and there¡¯s a reason why it hasn¡¯t been solved before.¡± ",WSJ
https://www.wsj.com/articles/domestic-abuse-gun-ban-in-peril-after-recent-supreme-court-ruling-ab1e5827?mod=Searchresults_pos13&page=5,2023-02-16,Supreme Court¡¯s Expansion of Gun Rights Puts Decades-Old Domestic-Abuser Ban in Peril,"Some  lower-court judges have rejected firearm ban for alleged abusers subject to protective orders

Federal law for nearly 30 years has barred gun possession for alleged domestic abusers, but the ban is coming under pressure from judges who say it is at odds with the Supreme Court¡¯s recent expansion of Second Amendment rights. 

Decisions from a federal appeals court and several trial judges have concluded the ban, included in the 1994 crime bill enacted by Congress, clashes with U.S. traditions of gun regulation, the new legal standard the Supreme Court announced in June.

Most notably, the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Feb. 2 tossed out the conviction of a man charged with illegally possessing several firearms. After police identified him as a suspect in multiple shootings, they obtained a warrant to search his home and found a stash of weapons along with a copy of a civil restraining order against him, obtained by an ex-girlfriend whom he allegedly assaulted and threatened to shoot.

The defendant, ¡°while hardly a model citizen, is nonetheless part of the political community entitled to the Second Amendment¡¯s guarantees,¡± Judge Cory T. Wilson wrote in the Fifth Circuit¡¯s ruling.

Under federal law, convicted felons are banned from owning firearms, as are those convicted of misdemeanor domestic-violence charges. The ban on gun ownership in the protective-order cases is different, applying to individuals who are subject to civil court orders that bar them from threatening or harassing an intimate partner. Spouses who fear for their safety can obtain such orders even if there are no corresponding criminal proceedings. The ban is among myriad gun regulations left vulnerable to challenges after the Supreme Court¡¯s 6-3 ruling last year striking down New York¡¯s handgun-permitting regime.

The decision in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association Inc. v. Bruen, written by Justice Clarence Thomas, split the court along ideological lines and fundamentally changed how courts are expected to judge the constitutionality of gun laws, subjecting restrictions to a far more demanding standard. Courts should give less weight to government concerns about gun violence and public safety, Justice Thomas wrote, and instead look to historical records to determine whether a gun restriction is ¡°consistent with this Nation¡¯s historical tradition of firearm regulation.¡±

Defenders of the domestic-violence gun ban have struggled to find evidence of states in the 1700s and 1800s seizing guns from the homes of violent spouses.

On the day the Fifth Circuit ruled, a U.S. district judge in Kentucky issued a similar opinion, finding no ¡°comparable historical analogue¡± to the 1994 ban. And in a Texas ruling from November, another federal judge said, ¡°The company Amazon is older than the federal laws prohibiting someone subject to a court order from possessing a firearm.¡± 

The decisions were all from judges appointed by Republican presidents.

Since Bruen, courts have ruled against a range of other gun laws, including a federal gun ban on marijuana users as well as restrictions on young adults and carrying weapons in certain locations, such as libraries, museums and bars.

¡°Before Bruen, pretty much all gun regulations were being upheld,¡± said George Mason University criminal-law professor Robert Leider, who favors a robust view of Second Amendment rights. ¡°There¡¯s been a reckoning because the historical test that Bruen announces collides with the fact that many of these laws have no historical pedigree.¡±

Pepperdine University law professor Jacob D. Charles, who has written critically of the Bruen decision, said the protective-order cases have exposed troubling aspects to the ruling, which ¡°allows courts to strike down a modern law protecting victims of domestic violence because the founders did not treat domestic abusers similarly.¡±

The Fifth Circuit itself said the new Supreme Court standard changed the outcome for the Texas defendant, Zackey Rahimi. 

In February 2020, Mr. Rahimi¡¯s then-girlfriend obtained a two-year protective order restraining him from threatening, stalking or harassing her or their toddler son. According to police and court records, he had assaulted her in a parked car and fired a shot in the air. A lawyer for Mr. Rahimi, who remains in custody facing multiple state criminal charges, declined to comment. 

Before the Bruen decision, the appeals court had affirmed Mr. Rahimi¡¯s federal conviction and 73-month prison sentence, citing earlier precedent that concluded the societal benefits of the domestic-violence protections outweighed any burden on the right to bear arms. But a new three-judge panel reconsidered the case in light of the new precedent and found that the ban was ¡°an outlier that our ancestors would never have accepted.¡±

Attorney General Merrick Garland said the Justice Department would seek further review of the case. The department also has appealed the trial-court rulings it recently lost.

The government likened the domestic-abuser statute to historical laws that kept guns away from suspected British loyalists and entire classes of residents deemed to be a threat, reaching as far back as English Militia Act of 1662, which allowed officers to seize arms from people judged ¡°dangerous to the Peace of the Kingdom.¡± The government also pointed to mid-19th-century statutes requiring individuals likely to disturb the peace to post bonds before carrying weapons in public. 

The appeals court found none of those laws ¡°relevantly similar¡± to the protection-order statute, or as burdensome on gun ownership.

Most states have their own laws that make it a crime to possess firearms while under a domestic-violence restraining order, many of which require individuals placed under orders to relinquish their firearms. Those state measures, like the federal ban, face uncertainty in light of the recent rulings.

Advocates for domestic-violence survivors and tougher firearm regulation say the domestic-violence gun ban saves lives, citing studies linking gun laws against abusers to reductions in spousal and dating homicides.  

Justice Stephen Breyer, dissenting in the Bruen case, cited research showing that abusive relationships are much more likely to turn deadly when violent partners have access to weapons. 

More than 100,000 gun sales were rejected from 1999 to 2020 because a criminal-background check showed the applicant subject to a disqualifying protection order, according to Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun-control advocacy group.

More cases on the issue remain in the courts, with the potential to widen a split among judges.

U.S. District Judge Timothy DeGiusti in Oklahoma, a President George W. Bush appointee, upheld the statute in a late-summer ruling. While there was a ¡°paucity of evidence¡± that American traditions addressed guns and domestic relationships, the judge said, the 1994 ban is ¡°consistent with the longstanding and historical prohibition on the possession of firearms by felons.¡±",WSJ

WASHINGTON?A new era of divided government dawns this week as the 118th Congress begins, with Republicans looking to deploy their power with a fragile majority in the House and Democrats doing the same in the Senate.

The House of Representatives will convene on Tuesday, a date designated by the 20th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution that stipulates Congress should begin each new session at noon on Jan. 3.

The opening session is expected to kick off two years of intense political battles over everything from immigration policy to inflation to domestic energy production. With the economy cooling down and the war in Ukraine continuing, the two parties are also expected to spar over the amount of money dedicated to strengthening the U.S. military¡¯s position against Russia and China, the best way to stimulate U.S. manufacturing sectors and what role the U.S. government should play in preventing supply-chain problems. 

As a result, the pace of new legislation is expected to slow compared with what advanced under Democratic President Biden¡¯s first two years on issues such as healthcare, climate, infrastructure, veterans¡¯ care and gun control. 

The White House will seek to offer a reminder of those achievements with a number of events this week. On Wednesday, Mr. Biden is scheduled to hold an event in Kentucky that will be attended by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) to tout the 2021 infrastructure bill. Mr. McConnell was one of 19 Republicans who voted for the measure in the Senate, while 13 GOP lawmakers backed it in the House.

Political analysts say congressional leaders could still find common ground on bipartisan issues such as confronting China¡¯s economic dominance and reining in Big Tech, whether by breaking up large companies through antitrust measures, coming up with privacy rules for handling user data, or changing consequences they face for hosting controversial content. 

Sarah Binder, a political-science professor at George Washington University, said divided government will make it harder for U.S. policy makers to solve problems such as climate change, immigration and funding Social Security and Medicaid. Republicans have given few signs that they are interested in compromising with Mr. Biden on those issues.

¡°You end up bucking problems to the future, and they get worse and harder to solve,¡± she said. 

The crucial task at the outset of a new session will be electing a new speaker, a vote that will highlight divides not just within the House but also the Republican party. Republican leader Kevin McCarthy of California has been working frantically to get the 218 votes needed?if all House members are present?in a roll-call vote. 

But Republicans are still wrangling with leadership over some of the details, which may help determine the outcome of Mr. McCarthy¡¯s bid. Some Republicans want to strengthen the motion to vacate, which, before Democrats changed the rule in 2019, allowed rank-and-file members to remove a speaker with relative ease. 

Mr. McCarthy has offered a proposal to make speaker ousting easier, but it is unclear whether that proposal is enough to win over a handful of conservatives who have withheld their support for his ambition to hold the gavel. 

Republicans will have 222 members to start the session, with 212 for Democrats and one vacancy. After that election, the new speaker is expected to administer the oath of office to all House members.

Control of the House has switched between political parties 11 times since 1910, most recently in 2019, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. Each party shift has brought a change in the chamber¡¯s priorities.

House Republicans have laid out their focus in a plan dubbed the ¡°Commitment to America.¡± It calls for four main themes: fighting inflation and curbing costs; reducing crime and securing the border; a freedom-themed category related to schools; and a focus on accountable government.

¡°The American people spoke on Nov. 8 and decided it was time for a new direction,¡± House Majority Leader-elect Steve Scalise (R., La.) said in a letter sent to Republican colleagues on Friday. 

The first vote they plan to take will be to repeal the funding for the Internal Revenue Service that was included in legislation passed by Democrats last August known as the Inflation Reduction Act. It provided $80 billion to the IRS for expansion of tax enforcement, and the administration said last year that could include hiring 87,000 new employees. Some would be agents and auditors to crack down on tax dodging; some would answer phones or rebuild aging computer systems to clear up long-running customer-service problems. 

Democrats said the bolstered IRS would bring the country needed revenue. Republicans said that the new agents would unfairly pursue small-business owners.

House Republicans also plan to bring up a measure creating a bipartisan select committee on the ¡°strategic competition¡± between the U.S. and China and a handful of bills reflecting antiabortion priorities.

In the near term, House Republicans are expected to launch investigations into the origins of Covid-19, and conduct oversight hearings on the performance of many of Mr. Biden¡¯s cabinet secretaries, including Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, over what Republicans call lax U.S. border policy. The Oversight Committee also plans to investigate the business dealings of Mr. Biden¡¯s son, Hunter Biden. Democrats have suggested Republicans plan to focus on partisan investigations rather than substantive issues. 

Democrats have already selected their leadership for the next Congress. Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D., N.Y.) is scheduled to succeed Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California as the party¡¯s leader, making him the first Black person to lead a major political party in Congress. Reps. Katherine Clark (D., Mass.) and Pete Aguilar (D., Calif.) were elected to the No. 2 and 3 positions in the Democratic minority, respectively. 

Any GOP legislation passed by the House would need to also be approved by the Senate, where Democrats will control 51 seats and most bills require 60 votes to advance. Mr. Biden can also veto legislation he opposes.

Senate lawmakers are scheduled to convene on Tuesday, but without a substantive agenda. After Tuesday, they don¡¯t meet again until Monday, Jan. 23. 

The effects of Republican control of the House would become immediately apparent if Mr. McCarthy follows through on his promise to end remote voting. House lawmakers have been able to vote from home since March 2020 amid the pandemic, and Mrs. Pelosi extended that practice several times. The latest extension expires Tuesday. Republicans unsuccessfully challenged remote voting in the courts. 

After electing a new speaker, House lawmakers are expected to vote on rules that lay out how the governing body will operate in the new year. Some lawmakers are hopeful the two parties will end up finding some common ground.

¡°We did get a bunch done in a bipartisan way from infrastructure to chips and China and building more domestic manufacturing here to standing by our veterans,¡± Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D., N.J.) said on MSNBC after the election. ¡°I think you¡¯ll see more of that.¡±

Rep. Nancy Mace (R., S.C.) said in a recent Fox News interview that she sees the slim majority as ¡°a mandate for us to work together.¡±

¡°Partisanship has reigned over the last couple of years¡¦but there are Republicans and there are Democrats who are willing to work together,¡± she added. ",WSJ
https://www.wsj.com/articles/gun-groups-financial-dealings-with-founder-spark-state-investigation-4ca2fe49?mod=Searchresults_pos17&page=5,2023-05-04,Gun Group¡¯s Financial Dealings With Founder Spark State Investigation,"The Second Amendment Foundation, a small but influential organization involved in scores of federal lawsuits to expand gun rights, is being investigated by the Washington state attorney general¡¯s office, with the organization saying investigators have examined transactions involving its founder.

The nonprofit, its founder and top executive, Alan Gottlieb, and other related entities this week sued the attorney general¡¯s office, saying the probe is politically motivated. State investigators seem to have shifting legal theories, the lawsuit claimed, among them that Mr. Gottlieb was ¡°unjustly enriching himself.¡± In the lawsuit, the plaintiffs denied any wrongdoing. 

 A review of the tax filings of the Second Amendment Foundation and the Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms, another nonprofit run by Mr. Gottlieb, shows what legal specialists called an unusual series of dealings with private entities owned by or controlled by Mr. Gottlieb. 

The nonprofits rent space in a Bellevue, Wash., office building that is owned by Mr. Gottlieb and his wife, the filings show. The organizations¡¯ biggest vendors include a direct-mail company Mr. Gottlieb owns, to which they each pay hundreds of thousands of dollars per year. The groups pay similar sums for back-office services to another company that Mr. Gottlieb founded and helps run. 

The foundation also employs Mr. Gottlieb¡¯s son, and his daughter-in-law briefly was on the payroll, filings show. Mr. Gottlieb said his wife until recently was getting $24,000 per year from the company that provides back-office services to the nonprofits.  

The two nonprofits have paid Mr. Gottlieb, family members or entities associated with him at least $22 million from 2010 through 2021, amounting to about 27 cents of every dollar raised by the two organizations over that period, a review of the nonprofits¡¯ filings by The Wall Street Journal shows.

In an interview, Mr. Gottlieb said he has complied with all nonprofit laws and has been transparent about the related-party transactions in the groups¡¯ annual filings. He said he abstains from board decisions concerning his private entities. None of his family members returned messages seeking comment. 

Service Bureau Association, his company that provides back-office services, is a nonprofit cooperative that works for the gun-rights groups and his private mailing firm at cost, according to Mr. Gottlieb and his lawsuit. All the arrangements lower the nonprofits¡¯ ¡°cost in overhead and operations,¡± he said.

In the lawsuit against Washington State Attorney General Bob Ferguson, a Democrat, filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Seattle, Mr. Gottlieb said he is being targeted for his pro-gun advocacy.  The lawsuit says the attorney general has ¡°carried out an expansive, highly intrusive probe into the private affairs¡± of Mr. Gottlieb, his family, his nonprofits and the two Gottlieb entities that provide services to the nonprofits. 

¡°It¡¯s my job as Attorney General to enforce Washington laws prohibiting self-dealing and the illegal misappropriation of charitable donations,¡± Mr. Ferguson said in a statement. ¡°We don¡¯t have a comment on this confidential investigation that Mr. Gottlieb chose to make public.¡± He said he expects to prevail in the case. 

Investigators have made demands for decades-old documents and have put gag orders on the groups¡¯ accountants, the suit said. Mr. Gottlieb, in an interview, said he¡¯d been deposed earlier this year and ¡°it didn¡¯t go very well for them.¡± 

Mr. Ferguson, who this week announced he is running for governor, has often sparred in court with Mr. Gottlieb¡¯s foundation over gun-control measures in the state. Last month, the Second Amendment Foundation sued Mr. Ferguson and other Washington state officials in an effort to overturn that state¡¯s new assault-weapons ban.

Mr. Gottlieb, 76 years old, founded the Second Amendment Foundation in 1974. He was convicted of filing a false federal income tax statement in the 1980s and served less than a year in prison. ¡°I almost wear it as a badge of honor,¡± Mr. Gottlieb said, because ¡°people who wanted to destroy my life¡± didn¡¯t succeed.

Early on, the foundation came to be known by other gun-rights proponents as the ¡°gun lobby¡¯s lobby,¡± by pushing the National Rifle Association to embrace more hardline positions. 

More recently, the foundation has emerged as a major player in gun-rights litigation, especially after the NRA ran into legal and financial troubles. The NRA¡¯s top officials are battling allegations of self-enrichment by New York state¡¯s attorney general, which they have denied. 

The foundation has been involved in hundreds of federal cases over gun laws. The foundation¡¯s attorneys helped overturn Chicago¡¯s handgun ban a decade ago and recently persuaded a federal judge to toss out a Minnesota law that limited handgun-carry permits to those over the age of 21. 

 Donations to Mr. Gottlieb¡¯s two nonprofits have risen in recent years as some gun owners turn away from the NRA and look for other organizations to advance their cause. 

In 2021, the most recent year for which tax records are available, Mr. Gottlieb¡¯s Second Amendment Foundation had total revenue of $7.4 million, up 44% from the prior year. The Citizens Committee?which lobbies lawmakers to oppose gun restrictions?had revenue of $2.7 million, a 17% increase from 2020. NRA revenue dropped 19% in the same period to $227 million. 

Richard Feldman, a former NRA lobbyist, said that Mr. Gottlieb has managed to be an effective advocate for the Second Amendment on a modest budget, and that in recent years ¡°Alan has been responsible for more litigation than anyone else.¡±

In 2021, Mr. Gottlieb drew salary and benefits worth about $90,000 in total from his two non-profits, according to tax filings. Mr. Gottlieb said he also makes money through Merril Mail Marketing, his direct-mailing company that does business with his nonprofits, but declined to provide figures.

The 7,000-square-foot office building in Bellevue that houses the nonprofits was purchased jointly by the Gottliebs and the nonprofits, which later sold their stake to the couple. The two entities now pay the Gottliebs more than $120,000 a year in rent, plus additional sums for upkeep, filings show. Mr. Gottlieb said the rent is at below-market rates. 

Among the largest assets owned by the nonprofits are three talk-radio stations, which feature conservative and pro-gun programming. One of them was partly owned by Mr. Gottlieb before the nonprofits bought his stake for $1.1 million in 2009, filings show. Mr. Gottlieb is president of all three stations, Federal Communications Commission filings show. The FCC approved the transfer of Mr. Gottlieb¡¯s ownership stake. 

Mr. Gottlieb said the nonprofits bought his radio-station stake at below-market rates and neither he nor any family member takes any salary or other benefits from the radio stations. 

If related-party transactions are disclosed and are done at fair-market prices, such dealings can be legal, said Elizabeth Schmidt, a professor at University of Massachusetts Amherst, who teaches about nonprofit law and management and has no relationship with Mr. Gottlieb¡¯s groups. But she said the extent of the related-party dealings in this case raises red flags.

¡°If I were the IRS and had enough money to audit this is exactly the type of thing I would audit,¡± she said. ¡°It doesn¡¯t smell right.¡± ",WSJ
https://www.wsj.com/articles/three-books-on-the-second-amendment-a2c669e8?mod=Searchresults_pos2&page=6,2023-08-04,Three Books on the Second Amendment,"ecent books by a novelist, a professor and a legal academic might inject new insights into the old debate on guns in America?or not.

There is no political solution to the problem of guns in America. Gun-control advocates believe the proper response to mass shootings is to make firearms harder to get. Opponents cite the fact that hundreds of millions of guns are already in circulation, and the concomitant reality that no regulation will ever alter the fact that if you want a gun you can get one; and so they resist even the mildest restrictions. The whole debate, if that¡¯s the right word for it, has been stale and repetitive since the mid-1990s.

The novelist Paul Auster, in ¡°Bloodbath Nation,¡± seems momentarily aware that to say something original or useful about the nightmarish succession of mass murders by armed lunatics in this country over the last 30 or 40 years requires a writer to look beyond a governmental solution. ¡°The immense problem we are facing as a country is not likely to be solved by enacting new laws or rescinding old laws or pushing innovative safety measures through Congress,¡± he writes. ¡°Piecemeal legislation might help mitigate some of the damage, but it will never go to the heart of the problem.¡±

And what is the heart of the problem? The answer, never as explicit as I would have preferred, seems to require that we?¡°we¡± meaning Americans?think long and hard about the many acts of mass murder perpetrated by people empowered by firearms. Toward that end, Mr. Auster describes some of these acts in gruesome detail?and intersperses the text with photographs of the sites. (The images are grainy, black-and-white and unimpressively produced.) Having immersed our minds in the horror of it all, we will, the author seems to say, come up with a solution.

Mr. Auster?much like the horror writer Stephen King in his Kindle single, ¡°Guns,¡± published in 2013?writes as though a novelist¡¯s display of moral revulsion and outrage can somehow bring everybody to their senses. Of course, very few readers of a book on guns by the notably left-wing Mr. Auster need to be persuaded of his views on the subject, and accordingly the book often feels like an exercise in fruitless exhibitionism.

It is, for one thing, full of specious arguments the author thinks to be profound. For example: Since cars were made safer over time, guns could be too. ¡°And make no mistake about it,¡± he writes, ¡°cars are not terribly different from guns. A high-powered automatic rifle and a four-thousand-pound Chevy barreling down a highway . . . are both lethal weapons.¡± The comparison, he contends, ¡°begs the question: If we could face up to the dangers represented by cars and use our brains and sense of common purpose to combat those dangers, why haven¡¯t we been able to do the same with guns?¡±

There¡¯s a lot wrong with that comparison?cars are not designed as weapons, and no safety function on a car is going to stop you from using it to kill people if you want to. But the relevant point is that guns have been regulated and made safer over the decades. Also?and do forgive the impertinence?but what novelist writes ¡°make no mistake¡± and uses ¡°begs the question¡± when he means ¡°raises the question¡±?

At points Mr. Auster seems to follow what I take to be his instinctive view that the horrors he describes arise from more than the availability of guns. ¡°The single word that runs through all [the perpetrators¡¯] stories is loneliness,¡± he writes, ¡°unbearable, mind-crushing loneliness.¡± That¡¯s true. But it makes me wonder why Mr. Auster didn¡¯t write a book about loneliness, a subject that hasn¡¯t been written and blabbered about endlessly, instead of guns, which has. By the end of the book, though, it¡¯s all the guns¡¯ fault again: ¡°People shoot other people with guns because they have guns.¡±

To register skepticism of the viewpoint expressed in that last statement is not to deny that the firearms industry has lately cultivated some baleful conventions. It¡¯s not unreasonable?I say this as a gun-owner who grew up in a home full of high-quality revolvers and shotguns?to look at a black semiautomatic rifle with pistol grips and a large protruding magazine and ask if it has any purpose other than to kill people. The popularity of these ferocious weapons is, in part, an expression of a political outlook?an outlook that, let¡¯s say, has its cynical and nihilistic side.

Jennifer Carlson, an associate professor of sociology and public policy at the University of Arizona, attempts to describe that political outlook in ¡°Merchants of the Right: Gun Sellers and the Crisis of American Democracy.¡± You can guess the book¡¯s tenor by its catastrophizing title, but Ms. Carlson¡¯s premise?that mom-and-pop gun stores have become little arenas of political debate?has some appeal. ¡°Gun stores are not entirely unlike nineteenth-century coffeehouses and salons that, as Habermas saw it, provided the infrastructure for the public sphere,¡± she writes. (A quibble: The coffeehouse and salon culture described in the book to which she refers, J?rgen Habermas¡¯s 1962 ¡°Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere,¡± was a phenomenon of the 17th and 18th centuries, not the 19th.)

But Ms. Carlson, we learn, didn¡¯t actually go to the gun stores she writes about. She wanted to ¡°comply with pandemic restrictions on research, travel, and social distancing¡± and so only talked to her interviewees on the phone. Her attempt to turn this vice into a virtue is unconvincing (¡°remote interviews . . . helped advance my own thinking on qualitative research methods¡±). My guess is that the book would have benefitted from face-to-face interviews: Her accounts of gun-store owners are so packed with uncharitable assumptions about them that you wonder if she expected to learn anything at all.

In a chapter on partisanship, to take one of many examples, she quotes remarks by Jake, ¡°a white gun seller from Florida.¡± Jake laments the fact that politics has divided members of his family. ¡°Unfortunately,¡± he tells Ms. Carlson, ¡°the die-hard liberals will not communicate with the conservatives?even though we don¡¯t ever talk politics! . . . Their opinions are up to them, we still love them for it?but they don¡¯t feel the same way. And I feel that¡¯s indicative of how the country is today.¡±

Thus does this gun-store owner come about as close to an expression of cross-party affection as one is likely to find in 21st-century America: ¡°we still love them.¡± For Ms. Carlson, though, Jake is the partisan one here because?now get this?he blames only liberals for partisanship. ¡°The presumption that liberals, leftists, and Democrats are closed-minded elitists,¡± she writes of Jake¡¯s views, ¡°not only legitimates antipathy toward them but also voices the underlying political, cultural, and economic anxieties that fester below the surface of contemporary American politics.¡± The possibility that Jake¡¯s representation of his extended family is accurate, or that highly educated liberals might think more poorly of the typical ¡°white gun seller from Florida¡± than he thinks of them, doesn¡¯t occur to Ms. Carlson.

Behind these and every other argument over guns in America is, of course, the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution: ¡°A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.¡± Carl T. Bogus, a law professor at Roger Williams University, argues in ¡°Madison¡¯s Militia: The Hidden History of the Second Amendment¡± that James Madison wrote the amendment to satisfy the demands of Southern slave owners who feared that the federal government would outlaw state militias?their best defense against slave revolts.

The book, an expansion of a 1998 article in the U.C. Davis Law Review, advances an argument that one side of the gun debate will happily accept. But my suspicions were raised on page 8, where the author concedes that his argument relies on circumstantial evidence, explains what circumstantial evidence is and isn¡¯t, and claims the book is ¡°more interesting¡± for relying on it.

Mr. Bogus writes clearly and engagingly, although a quick reading of the original hundred-page article suggests that the book doesn¡¯t add much to his argument¡¯s substance. A full-length academic monograph is a lot to read for such a narrow payoff, even if you agree with it.

Which I do not. The book¡¯s contention relies on the belief that very few people in America¡¯s Revolutionary-era political class still believed that standing armies threatened liberty and that militias were therefore needed to safeguard it. If they really no longer believed that, as Mr. Bogus says, Madison¡¯s words about a well-regulated militia being necessary to freedom was cant, a sop to slave-owners. But many statesmen at the time praised militias as a bulwark against tyranny, and Mr. Bogus¡¯s insistence that their words were insincere does not convince. Nor does his thesis explain why, if militias were so outmoded, two states that had no interest in protecting slavery, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, adopted constitutional provisions safeguarding militias.

The point of the book, it¡¯s not hard to work out, is to denigrate the Second Amendment by associating it with slavery and thus discredit the contention that it guarantees an individual¡¯s right to own guns. Mr. Bogus avoids the thorny matter of the Second Amendment¡¯s legal interpretations, but on the book¡¯s final page he suggests that Madison and his colleagues would have been ¡°astounded¡± that the Amendment is now thought to permit individual gun ownership. I can think of many strange and now prevalent interpretations of the U.S. Constitution that would astound the Founders. That¡¯s not one of them.",WSJ
https://www.wsj.com/articles/utahs-senate-race-gets-personal-mike-lee-evan-mcmullin-mormon-midterm-cia-attack-ad-inflation-2020-trump-constitution-11667569562?mod=Searchresults_pos4&page=6,2023-11-04,Mike Lee and Evan McMullin Get Personal,"Trump is the main issue that divides the Utah senator and his challenger. The campaign is unsurprisingly nasty.

Salt Lake City

If the 235,000 registered Democrats in Utah joined with the 480,000 unaffiliated voters and 93,000 members of minor parties, they still wouldn¡¯t outnumber the state¡¯s 880,000 registered Republicans. Utah was turning into a one-party state even before the Reagan revolution in 1980. Republicans have won every election for governor since 1982 and for U.S. senator since 1970.

Evan McMullin, a former Republican running for Senate as an independent, wants to change that. Once the Democratic Party decided this spring to back Mr. McMullin in lieu of putting up its own nominee, this year¡¯s Senate race in Utah boiled down to a numbers game: Do Democrats, centrist and left-leaning independents, and anti-Trump Republicans add up to more than the populist, conservative and partisan Republicans committed to two-term incumbent Sen. Mike Lee?

The 2016 election makes such an outcome look possible. Mr. Lee was easily re-elected that year, but Mr. McMullin ran for president as an anti-Trump independent. Although Mr. Trump carried Utah, he received only 45.5% of the vote. Hillary Clinton and Mr. McMullin combined for 49%, with the balance going to minor-party candidates. The 2020 results proved less promising: Mr. Trump beat Joe Biden by more than 20 points.

¡°I¡¯m running because our politics are broken and our country¡¯s coming apart,¡± Mr. McMullin said in an interview. For his part, Mr. Lee insisted, ¡°From the time I was 10 years old, I¡¯ve been a student of the Constitution, and whether voters agree with me or not¡± about any particular issue, ¡°they know that I know the Constitution.¡± He added that his ¡°sole purpose is to keep the federal government in its lane.¡±

Missing in the race is much policy difference. ¡°As I travel the state, I hear about three issues more than all others combined,¡± Mr. Lee said. ¡°The top one is inflation, and the second one is inflation. And the third one is also inflation. . . . Inflation has hit Utah especially hard.¡± Mr. McMullin makes the same point: ¡°Economic issues are really the most important. We¡¯re experiencing inflation in Utah that¡¯s worse than most other states.¡±

On abortion, gun control, student-debt repayment and even immigration, the candidates¡¯ declared positions are similar. To get to any meaningful differences in policy, voters have to move deep into the weeds. In their only debate, in Orem on Oct. 17, Messrs. Lee and McMullin agreed that pharmaceutical prices are too high. They disagreed only about the mechanism for forcing them down. Mr. Lee wants to legalize imports of price-controlled drugs, while Mr. McMullin wants the government to negotiate prices with manufacturers.

The candidates want the election to be about vague political stereotypes?Mr. Lee as a Trumpian insurrectionist and Mr. McMullin as a Biden-loving wolf in conservative clothing. ¡°Lee walks around with his little pocket Constitution next to his heart,¡± Robert Bishop, a Utah tech executive, griped, ¡°but he trampled it under his feet when he was involved in discussions of how to overturn the election.¡± Jenny Wilson, mayor of Salt Lake County and one of the few elected Democrats in the state, insisted that ordinary Utahns don¡¯t identify with Mr. Trump, but ¡°Republican political leaders, ones that are active in the political space, including Lee, migrated to him.¡±

Mr. McMullin has pushed this line, accusing Mr. Lee during their debate of ¡°the most egregious betrayal of our nation¡¯s Constitution in its history by a U.S. senator¡± for texts he sent to Mr. Trump¡¯s chief of staff about legal ways to overturn the 2020 election results. Mitt Romney, Utah¡¯s other senator, gave only the tepid comment, ¡°I don¡¯t think Mr. Lee has done anything illegal,¡± and has refused to endorse either candidate.

As for Mr. McMullin, he says if elected he wouldn¡¯t caucus with either party, but his opponents¡¯ supporters don¡¯t believe it. Trent Christensen, CEO of a local venture-capital firm, said Mr. McMullin ¡°would absolutely lean Democrat, 100% lean Democrat. . . . The only times that McMullin has shown up has been to play the foil to a Republican.¡± Jeff Jennings, a St. George broadcasting executive, insisted Mr. McMullin is ¡°really just a Democrat.¡± Mr. Lee himself said: ¡°If it walks like a duck, if it quacks like a duck, if it has wet feet like a duck, in this case, it¡¯s a Democrat. He¡¯s a Democrat, just without the D after his name.¡±

The candidates¡¯ biographies are similar. Both are members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints; both went to Brigham Young University, the Mormon school in Provo; both served two-year foreign-language missions for the LDS church as young men.

Mr. McMullin went on to be a CIA operations officer before establishing himself as a respected analyst for conservatives, serving the House Republican Conference as chief policy director.

Mr. Lee comes from an old Republican family. His father, Rex Lee, was President Reagan¡¯s solicitor general and founding dean of the law school at BYU. Mike Lee clerked for Judge Samuel Alito on the Third U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and returned to clerk for a year when Justice Alito joined the Supreme Court. Before election to the Senate in 2010, he served as an assistant U.S. attorney in Salt Lake City and general counsel to then-Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr. (Mr. Huntsman has endorsed Mr. Lee in the current election.)

Both men initially opposed Mr. Trump¡¯s candidacy?Mr. Lee endorsed Sen. Ted Cruz in March 2016. But while Mr. Lee made his peace with the future president, Mr. McMullin quit the party and ran as an independent, attempting to be a spoiler. In the end he received 21.5% of the vote in Utah and he appeared on the ballot in only 11 states, collecting barely 0.5% nationwide. He endorsed Mr. Biden in 2020.

There has been much speculation about Mr. McMullin¡¯s declaration that he will caucus with neither party in the Senate. Mr. Lee said Mr. McMullin ¡°would end up affiliating with the Democrats, because before long he would realize that he couldn¡¯t get a committee assignment.¡± An old Senate rule seems to guarantee him two assignments on major committees, but no one is sure how the rule works, and, in any case, two committees is far from the 12 committees and subcommittees that the two parties typically assign to senators.

Attack ads are a flashpoint in the campaign. This spring Mr. McMullin¡¯s campaign put out an ad lambasting Mr. Lee as someone who was ¡°in on the scheme¡± to overturn the 2020 election. In September, Club for Growth Action put out an ad featuring a clip of Mr. McMullin saying, ¡°The Republican base is racist.¡± The full quote was, ¡°There is an element of the Republican base that is racist.¡± Mr. McMullin has filed a lawsuit alleging that the elision is defamatory.

The utility of such ads is unclear in the heavily Mormon Beehive State. Utahns are almost aggressively wholesome, and they recoil when asked about attack ads. They ¡°just make me feel like neither of them are really great candidates,¡± said Alexander Jackson, an architect from Provo. ¡°Utah has its quirks, but it¡¯s a nice state,¡± added Lake Hale, a respiratory-therapy assistant, and this kind of ad ¡°turns voters off a little bit.¡±

But given that the two candidates¡¯ main difference is their attitude toward Mr. Trump, the campaign was probably bound to be personal. Will Utah¡¯s voters accept the caricature of Mike Lee, a distinguished lawyer from a distinguished legal family, as an obedient Trump stooge? Will they accept the caricature of Evan McMullin, a sophisticated CIA operative and senior policy analyst, as a secret Democrat who will abandon every conservative principle he claims to hold?

After summer and early fall polling that showed Mr. McMullin within 3 to 5 points of Mr. Lee, the incumbent seems to be pulling away. Mr. Lee was up 10 points in a late October poll by Emerson University. Voters seem to be sticking with the Republican Party?and the man they elected to the Senate 12 years ago.",WSJ
https://www.wsj.com/articles/republicans-corporations-donations-pacs-9b5b202b?mod=Searchresults_pos6&page=6,2023-06-14,How Republicans and Big Business Broke Up,"WASHINGTON?Once considered natural political allies, the Republican Party and big business are drifting apart. One sign of their estrangement: GOP lawmakers are weaning themselves off money from corporate political-action committees.

Republicans are now less dependent on corporate and industry PACs than at any time in the past three decades, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis based on data from the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. Instead, they are turning to smaller donations from millions of individuals who tend to be wary of big-businesses priorities such as free trade.

Conservatives say the fault for the breakup lies with CEOs who increasingly meddle in politics by taking progressive stances on divisive social issues. Executives who had hoped such rancor would fade when Donald Trump left office are now facing a hostile GOP in Congress.   

Republicans have emerged as the unlikely champions of reining in industries from Big Tech to Wall Street. Some are taking up causes once associated with old-school Democrats, advancing bills that give more power to the federal government to raise wages for blue-collar workers and lower drug costs for consumers. 

¡°Gone are the days that Republicans are going to sit on the sidelines as big behemoths take advantage of the American people,¡± said Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee in a written statement to the Journal. ¡°We are going to hold them accountable,¡± she added.

House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has lived through the cycle. In the 2016 election that swept Trump to the White House, pro-business groups saw an ally in the Republican from California¡¯s conservative-leaning agricultural heartland. 

More than 40% of the money given to his re-election campaign that year came from business PACs. As House majority leader, he pushed for business-friendly legislation that included reduced regulations on big banks, a historic tax cut for corporations and a sweeping free-trade deal with Mexico and Canada.

By 2022, when a Republican tide elevated McCarthy to speaker, the corporate-money pipeline was dwindling, accounting for less than 3% of his campaign funds. And McCarthy¡¯s friendship with big business was fraying.  

These days, McCarthy is using his position to castigate Wall Street for taking progressive political stands. He opposed industry-endorsed measures to expand federal spending on infrastructure, liberalize immigration rules and a bill to provide $53 billion in financial assistance and incentives for the U.S. semiconductor industry.

The Republican Party¡¯s ¡°shifting sentiment away from corporate America is a result of their increasing activism that alienates Republicans and their constituents,¡± said Matt Sparks, an adviser to McCarthy and his former deputy chief of staff.

The Journal¡¯s analysis looked at the number of Republicans in the House who received at least 40% of their campaign war chests from industry and corporate PACs, which raise money through voluntary contributions from executives and managers. 

It is still far from clear whether the break with big business is permanent. Most Republican members of Congress say they continue to embrace free-enterprise policies that have prevailed in the party for decades, such as reducing government regulation on industry, lowering taxes and limiting the clout of labor unions.

There are signs that some CEOs are reconsidering the wisdom of weighing in on sensitive political or social matters. Several financial-services CEOs have met with McCarthy to tell him that they are doing their best to avoid speaking publicly about such topics, according to people familiar with the meetings.

Republican lawmakers ¡°appreciate when these guys come in and acknowledge the elephant and say, ¡®I am the leader of a big institution with lots of perspectives and I am doing my best as a CEO to avoid talking about some of these issues and focus on running my company,¡¯ ¡± said John Stipicevic, a former longtime aide to the speaker who is now a corporate lobbyist. 

Recent Republican legislative initiatives include measures to break up the meatpacking industry,  tighten safety regulations for railroads and allow the federal government to claw back bonuses from executives whose banks fail. They¡¯re also turning to the Justice Department, the Federal Trade Commission and other federal agencies to curb industries that they believe are harming Americans. 

¡°At least on certain issues like tech, we¡¯re going to have to accept the fact that the DOJ, the FTC have a role to play here,¡± said Sen. J.D. Vance (R., Ohio), one of a new group of populist Republicans recently elected to the Senate. ¡°I think the only enemy that can rein in tech companies is the federal government.¡±

The bad blood extends well beyond Washington. Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Walt Disney are locked in a high-stakes legal battle over corporate power, governmental control and freedom of speech.

In Texas, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott and the GOP-run state house banned the state from doing business with BlackRock, and several other banks after accusing them of boycotting investments in the oil industry in favor of renewable-fuel companies. In January, Texas banned from the state¡¯s municipal-bond business after the state attorney general said the bank discriminates against gun manufacturers. 

A spokesman for Citigroup said the bank doesn¡¯t discriminate against gun manufacturers and ¡°simply uses industry best practices in terms of firearms sales.¡±

A BlackRock spokesman said the company supports investments in both fossil fuels and renewable energy. A spokesman for JPMorgan referred to comments CEO Jamie Dimon made during the company¡¯s annual shareholder meeting in May, in which he called himself ¡°a red-blooded, patriotic, free-enterprise and free-market capitalist (properly regulated, of course).¡± 

The proposed $20 billion merger between grocery giants Albertsons and Kroger has come under fire from Republicans not only on antitrust grounds but also over issues of corporate culture.

At a Senate hearing on the merger in November, Sen. Tom Cotton (R., Ark.) questioned CEO Rodney McMullen about why the company had fired two employees who refused to wear an apron with a gay-pride insignia.

The senator cited the firings as an example of a corporation imposing progressive social positions on employees?and said Republicans were growing weary of reflexively defending the biggest U.S. companies.

¡°They probably shouldn¡¯t come and ask Republican senators to carry the water for them,¡± he said, ¡°whenever our Democratic friends want to regulate them or block their mergers.¡±

In response to the senator, McMullen said ¡°we think it¡¯s incredibly important to be an inclusive, open culture to welcome all associates.¡±

Some academics say that big corporations are increasingly taking progressive stances on issues such as gay rights, gun control and climate-change policy, often to cater to liberal workforces.

¡°Most large corporations are located in cities and companies are looking for young, educated workers, who increasingly have left-wing values?both of which push companies to be more progressive,¡± said Romain Wacziarg, a professor of economics at the UCLA Anderson School of Management.

Those stances have sparked cultural friction with many in the Republican Party, who increasingly represent less educated, blue-collar workers in rural areas who often tend to hold more conservative views on those issues. The result is a widening divide between U.S. companies and many Republicans.

Vance, the freshman GOP senator, said some Republican lawmakers are replacing their deep-seated distrust of the federal government with a realization that only the government is powerful enough to rein in such large corporations.

¡°This is not just a sort of mild shift,¡± said Vance. ¡°There is something structural here.¡±

Sen. Steve Daines (R., Mont.) first ran for Senate in 2014 on a pro-business platform, with corporate PACs bankrolling about 25% of his $7.5 million war chest.  

By the time Daines ran for re-election in 2020, Mr. Daines raised more than $30 million for his campaign, but just about 10% came from corporate PACs. 

Much of Daines¡¯s campaign funds came from small-dollar donors, who contribute $10, $25 or $50 each. In his second term, Daines changed some of his positions on business priorities, voting against reauthorizing the U.S. Export-Import Bank, bucking a lobbying push by , and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. 

In June of 2021, he joined seven Senate Republicans to require union-scale wages on certain public-works projects, a rare move for a member of the Republican Party. 

Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida was one of the Republicans who backed higher wages as part of a broader bill to give billions of dollars in federal money and incentives to encourage semiconductor companies to build new plants in the United States. 

¡°As we invest tens of billions of dollars into critical industries,¡± he said at the time, ¡°it is only right that we require that those funds also invest in the men and women who will build and maintain these cutting-edge facilities.¡±

Rubio was once a traditional conservative who espoused Ronald Reagan¡¯s pro-business agenda. 

Rubio has since reversed course on some issues. He publicly endorsed permitting employees of to form a labor union and has questioned free-trade agreements, especially with China. He calls his economic policy ¡°common-good capitalism,¡± aimed at raising wages for blue-collar workers. 

Many of the economic policies championed by Republicans early in his career didn¡¯t help American workers and ¡°led to a sustained period of decadence,¡± he writes in his book, ¡°Decades of Decadence,¡± which went on sale this week. 

After the train crash in East Palestine, Ohio, several Republicans blamed the company and its executives and jumped on legislation to create new safety measures for the U.S. railroad industry designed to protect consumers.

Among those supporting the bill are Rubio, Vance and Sen. Mitt Romney (R., Utah).

¡°If you go to East Palestine, and you talk to people, yeah, they¡¯re very skeptical of the EPA,¡± Vance said, referring to the Environmental Protection Agency. ¡°But they really hate Norfolk Southern.¡±

Norfolk Southern declined to comment. The company¡¯s CEO said earlier this year that he was sorry about the accident and that safety measures weren¡¯t enough to prevent it.

Many industry chiefs initially cheered the results of the November elections because the win by Republicans ousted Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and replaced Democratic committee chairs with a group of Republicans they thought would be aligned with the interests of industry. 

Instead, newly empowered Republican committee chairs launched investigations into Wall Street firms, Big Tech companies and others for actions such as promoting gay-friendly policies, limiting loans to fossil-fuel companies and doing business in China. 

Rep. James Comer (R., Ky.), the new chair of the House Oversight Committee, demanded answers from , Express Scripts and others about their role in the cost of drugs. Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R., Ohio) issued subpoenas to executives at several Big Tech firms seeking documents related to what he considers their collusion with the federal government to suppress speech on their platforms. The tech industry has denied wrongdoing. 

In the Senate, every Republican incumbent who ran in both 2016 and 2022 received a smaller share of their money from corporate PACs in the most recent election than the prior one, the Journal found.

¡°I don¡¯t see any reason to take a dime from those folks,¡± said Sen. Josh Hawley, the Missouri Republican senator who has endorsed several populist bills. ¡°I¡¯m not going to be beholden in any way to their agenda. At the multinational level, more and more of these corporations, their agenda really diverges from the interests of American workers and the American middle class.¡± ",WSJ

Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, a pivotal centrist who has helped broker bipartisan deals and forced changes to major pieces of President Biden¡¯s agenda, said she was leaving the Democratic Party and would register as an independent, a move that complicates Democrats¡¯ narrow control of the chamber.

The move sent a jolt through Washington just days after Democrats secured their 51st seat in the Senate by winning a runoff election in Georgia. It raised questions about how closely Ms. Sinema would align with the party in the second half of Mr. Biden¡¯s term and introduced a new wrinkle in the outlook for the 2024 election, when she would be up for re-election and when Democrats are facing a tougher Senate map than in 2022.

¡°I have joined the growing numbers of Arizonans who reject party politics by declaring my independence from the broken partisan system in Washington,¡± she wrote in an opinion article in the Arizona Republic announcing her exit from the party. ¡°Showing up to work with the title of independent is a reflection of who I have always been,¡± she said in an accompanying video. ¡°Nothing¡¯s going to change about me.¡±

Ms. Sinema didn¡¯t say in her opinion article or the video whether she would caucus with Democrats, but she is keeping her committee assignments controlled by the Democrats and signaled that the move won¡¯t change the way she votes or works in the Senate. Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Angus King of Maine are both independents but caucus with Democrats and are counted as part of their majority.

In an interview with CNN, Ms. Sinema said questions about whether the Democrats¡¯ majority would remain at 51-49 or effectively become 50-49 was ¡°kind of a D.C. thing to worry about.¡±

Both Ms. Sinema and Democratic leadership danced around the question of how Ms. Sinema should be counted. Hannah Hurley, a spokeswoman for Ms. Sinema, didn¡¯t answer directly when asked whether Ms. Sinema could still be considered a member of the Democratic caucus.

¡°We are very clear: She intends to maintain her committee assignments, she is not a Democrat. She is an independent,¡± Ms. Hurley said when asked if Ms. Sinema would be included in Democrats¡¯ vote total the way Mr. King and Mr. Sanders are.

The White House and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) played down the importance of her move and praised the senator¡¯s record.

¡°She asked me to keep committee assignments and I agreed,¡± Mr. Schumer said. ¡°Kyrsten is independent; that¡¯s how she¡¯s always been. I believe she¡¯s a good and effective senator.¡± He didn¡¯t address whether he still considered Ms. Sinema a member of his caucus.

Ms. Sinema informed Mr. Schumer of her decision on Thursday, according to a Democratic aide.

Just days earlier, Mr. Schumer celebrated the win of the 51st seat at a press conference, holding up five fingers on one hand and one finger on the other. Even with Ms. Sinema¡¯s decision, Democrats will still have more sway in committees and investigations than they did in the current 50-50 Senate, in which they have a power-sharing agreement with Republicans that has slowed down nominees and required agreement on subpoenas in congressional investigations.

The White House said it expected Ms. Sinema to continue to join with the administration on its agenda. ¡°We don¡¯t see a change in the Democratic majority with her decision to register as an independent,¡± said White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre.

While not auguring any immediate shake-up in Senate power, Ms. Sinema¡¯s decision softens Democrats¡¯ formal majority headed into the new Congress, when Republicans will take control of the House. Deaths or resignations could shift the balance of power, or tempt a lawmaker to try their luck with the other party, as the late Sen. Jim Jeffords did in 2001. Less than six months after GOP President George W. Bush took office, the Vermont Republican declared himself an independent and began caucusing with the Democrats, giving them control of the Senate.

In the past two years, Democrats have managed to maneuver some major partisan measures through the evenly divided Senate, but passing legislation required all Democrats to agree if Republicans were united in opposition. That gave effective veto power to Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Ms. Sinema, who forced the party to make changes and cuts to its tax, healthcare and climate law.

In the next Congress starting in January, any individual Democratic senator had been expected to have less leverage over the agenda, thanks to the Georgia win. But Ms. Sinema¡¯s move created new uncertainties for Democrats.

Ms. Sinema has regularly worked across the aisle, playing a central role in efforts to build bipartisan deals on infrastructure spending, gun-control legislation and shoring up same-sex marriage rights. While a reliable vote on Mr. Biden¡¯s judicial and executive-branch nominees and routine legislation, she has clashed with fellow Democrats on some major bills and efforts to change Senate rules, regularly arguing that politics in Washington are too partisan.

Notably, she and Mr. Manchin refused to support a push to get rid of the Senate¡¯s 60-vote filibuster threshold for most legislation to Democratic priorities, such as voting-access legislation, saying that it would undercut efforts by lawmakers to work across party lines.

During the months of talks over what became Mr. Biden¡¯s tax, climate and healthcare law, Ms. Sinema repeatedly upended Democrats¡¯ tax plans. She single-handedly forced the party to abandon its plans to raise the top marginal rates for corporate, capital-gains and individual-income taxes. In the summer, as Democrats finally reached an agreement with Mr. Manchin, Ms. Sinema held out on the deal until Democrats dropped plans to raise taxes on a key source of private-equity managers¡¯ income.

By the time the Senate narrowly passed the Inflation Reduction Act in August, it was a much smaller package than the White House¡¯s initial Build Back Better plan. In other areas of the talks, such as the expanded child tax credit, it was Mr. Manchin, not Ms. Sinema, who resisted the direction that most Democrats wanted to go.

A spokeswoman for Mr. Manchin declined to comment following Ms. Sinema¡¯s announcement Friday. Mr. Manchin, who represents a state that voted for Donald Trump in 2020 by 39 points, has repeatedly dismissed questions about whether he might leave the Democratic Party.

Ms. Sinema¡¯s stances have regularly angered Democratic activists and sometimes frustrated Democratic colleagues and officials. Earlier this year, her relationship with state Democrats dissolved so completely that there were few Democrats she spoke to in the state, according to several Arizona Democrats. In one notorious incident in October 2021, activists followed Ms. Sinema into a bathroom to protest her efforts to pare back Mr. Biden¡¯s spending agenda.

Ms. Sinema has voted with Mr. Biden 93% of the time, according to FiveThirtyEight, a website focused on opinion-poll analysis.

Ms. Sinema is a polarizing figure in Arizona. The business community praised her record Friday. She ¡°has been one of the most effective members¡± of the Senate, said Danny Seiden, the CEO of the Arizona Chamber of Commerce.

The Arizona Democratic Party Chair Raquel Ter?n said Ms. Sinema has shown ¡°she answers to corporations and billionaires, not Arizonans.¡± The state party censured Ms. Sinema earlier this year over her vote with Mr. Manchin to preserve the Senate filibuster rule.

Ms. Sinema¡¯s move potentially strengthens her hand ahead of what was expected to be a bruising re-election campaign. Polls earlier this year showed Ms. Sinema would have a hard time winning the Democratic primary. Ms. Sinema¡¯s spokeswoman said the senator¡¯s decision to become an independent wasn¡¯t related to a potential primary challenge.

Democrats ¡°across the spectrum dislike the way Sinema operates so much that she gets no credit for passing widely popular legislation,¡± tweeted Tony Cani, who was Mr. Biden¡¯s deputy Arizona director in the 2020 presidential election.

In an interview with Newsmax, Rep. Andy Biggs (R., Ariz.) said he was on a plane with Ms. Sinema on Thursday night and she didn¡¯t mention the decision when they chatted. On becoming an independent, he said, ¡°She¡¯s kind of had that bent all along, and this seems to be a better home for her.¡±

In this year¡¯s midterm elections, Ms. Sinema said she supported fellow Arizona Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly and Secretary of State Katie Hobbs in her governor race, but didn¡¯t appear at public events for them. Ms. Hurley said Ms. Sinema donated to Mr. Kelly¡¯s campaign and ¡°helped however he asked.¡±

By becoming an independent, she forces state Democrats to decide whether it is worth running a candidate against her, which could create a three-way race. Such a move could split Democratic-leaning voters and ease the way for a Republican to win.

Rep. Ruben Gallego, who represents central Phoenix, has been making preparations to potentially run against Ms. Sinema, he said in an interview.

¡°The campaigns that focus on the voters, the working class people of Arizona, are going to win,¡± he said.

Arizona was once a solidly Republican state but it has become competitive in the years since Ms. Sinema was first elected in 2018. She was the first Democratic senator to represent the state in 30 years. Arizona voters are split roughly into thirds, with Republicans the largest voting bloc, followed by independents and then Democrats. Independents are the fastest-growing bloc.

Nathan Gonzales, editor and publisher of the nonpartisan publication Inside Elections, said a three-way race likely would benefit Republicans. While some Republicans like Ms. Sinema, that doesn¡¯t necessarily mean that they would embrace her over a Republican, he said.

Still, ¡°if Republicans nominate someone like Kari Lake, who is not acceptable to all of the Republican Party, then who knows?¡± he said, referring to the pro-Donald Trump candidate who narrowly lost her bid for governor in November.",WSJ

Is today¡¯s Republican party conservative or populist? Is its patron saint Ronald Reagan or Donald Trump? Is it more intent on slashing government spending or preserving entitlement programs? Did it underperform in the 2022 midterm elections because it failed to mobilize its base or because it failed to reassure other voters wary of extremism? The divisive House debate offered no clear answers.

But Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri thinks he has one: The Republican party, he argues, needs to chart its path forward by becoming, finally and unequivocally, the party of the American working class.

Sen. Hawley advanced perhaps the most provocative midterm postmortem when he wrote a piece in the Washington Post declaring that ¡°the old Republican Party is dead.¡± The much-anticipated giant red wave didn¡¯t materialize in 2022, he wrote, because Republicans have failed to complete a necessary transformation into the party of working-class Americans, who have been drifting into its ranks for years.

Sen. Hawley is at the forefront of a coterie of younger Republicans, in Congress and think tanks, who advocate policies that would mark a sharp break from the conservative, free-market gospel that has been the backbone of the GOP for more than half a century. They argue for abandoning free trade in favor of a network of tariffs to protect American goods and jobs, swearing off cuts to entitlement programs on which the working class rely, breaking up big tech firms, clamping down harder on immigration and finding common ground with union workers.

The incoming chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Rep. Jason Smith, promises ¡°a tax code that supports the millions of working-class families.¡± Sen. Marco Rubio has sponsored legislation that would funnel billions in government help to build or rebuild critical industries on American soil. Sen. Tom Cotton has authored a bill to shift government spending away from college education and toward workplace training programs.

If this sounds like a new formula for activist government, Republican-style?well, it is. In an interview, Sen. Hawley argues that this pivot would represent not a break from Republican beliefs but a return to the principles that guided the GOP in the days of Theodore Roosevelt and William McKinley, when the party was ¡°avowedly a nationalist party.¡± Moreover, he says the move is politically essential: ¡°We are not a majority party currently. If we want to be a majority party, we have to bring these working-class voters back to us.¡±

Still, such a pivot will be difficult to execute, with as much potential to tear apart the Republican party as to transform it. The business community, a core constituency that underwrites many GOP campaign efforts, generally prefers free trade over government-managed trade, sees virtue in immigration, and hopes for organized labor to be curbed rather than encouraged.

Others in the party see peril in moving away from what has been a bedrock Republican philosophy: that free-market policies produce broad economic growth that benefits all Americans.

The movement is based on a premise that traditional Republican policies ¡°somehow leave behind the working class,¡± says retiring Pennsylvania Sen. Patrick Toomey, a free-market conservative. ¡°And of course that¡¯s spectacularly wrong.¡± In his farewell address in the Senate in December, Mr. Toomey declared: ¡°I hope we resist the temptation to adopt the protectionist, nativist, isolationist, redistributive policies that some are suggesting we embrace.¡± Others in the party, including some in the new, narrow majority in the House, consider the primary goal at the moment to be reducing government spending and debt, even if that means curbing entitlements.

And meanwhile, of course, Democrats aren¡¯t simply going to let go of their traditional ties to unions and working-class voters. Indeed, President Biden took office vowing to reclaim such workers, and his administration is working on several fronts to rebuild those ties.

Two important forces are propelling this struggle. First, cultural issues and anxieties already have driven many working-class voters into Republican arms, making it necessary and perhaps inevitable that the party would consider doing more to accommodate their economic desires and needs.

Polling by The Wall Street Journal and NBC News in recent years shows the migration. The share of the Republican electorate made up of white voters without a college degree?a reasonable proxy for ¡°working class voters¡±?has risen from 48% in 2012 to 62% this year. Similarly, VoteCast, a broad national survey of voters conducted by the Associated Press, found that white voters without a college degree picked Republicans over Democrats in 2022 congressional races by a margin of 65% to 32%.

¡°I think the most significant political shift of the past decade has been the socio-economic inversion of the two parties,¡± says Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. ¡°Historically, the Republicans were the party of the rich, and the Democrats were the party of the working class.¡± Now, he contends, that is being reversed. Indeed, both the 2020 general election and the 2022 midterms showed that Republicans are making inroads not just with white working-class voters but with working-class Hispanics and Blacks as well.

Sen. Cruz says that GOP energy policies promoting continued fossil-fuel use, in contrast with Democrats¡¯ focus on climate change, also should be a central part of the agenda. ¡°If you¡¯re a Teamster and Democrats have spent two years trying to shut down trucking across the country, voting for Democrats is profoundly against your interests.¡±

In some respects, the call for a new economic gospel focused on working-class needs represents an attempt to shift the Republican appeal away from the cultural issues?gay rights, abortion, gun control?that have created a bond with many working-class voters until now and toward economic policies to address their concerns about the loss of manufacturing jobs and declining purchasing power.

Perhaps the most dramatic illustration of this shift came late last year, when Mr. Hawley and Mr. Rubio, along with four other Republican senators, voted to force railway companies to give unionized employees additional sick leave in a new labor contract. The measure failed, but the senators¡¯ embrace of an attempt by the government to compel an industry to accept more liberal terms in a labor agreement represented a sharp turn away from traditional Republican reliance on the wisdom of free markets and business leaders.

The second factor is that former president Donald Trump, despite his flaws and the damage he has done to the party in other ways, showed the potential for the Republican party to expand its reach into traditional Democratic constituencies. Indeed, the move to become the working-class party merely represents a continuation, and perhaps culmination, of the trends Mr. Trump unleashed.

Tony Fabrizio, who was a pollster for both of Mr. Trump¡¯s presidential campaigns, argues that Republicans can attract adherents for their ideas for government action now precisely because working-class voters think previous policies have ignored their needs. ¡°The people who are most angry and feel most left behind by government are those voters,¡± Mr. Fabrizio says.

Political jockeying aside, the struggle for the hearts and votes of the working class continues a long quest to determine what economic philosophy best serves their interests in a 21st-century economy.

Ronald Reagan pushed the Republican party and the country as a whole to the right with his 1980 presidential election. In winning that year, he got the votes of thousands of ¡°Reagan Democrats,¡± who detached from their traditional moorings in the Democratic party and voted Republican, at least in part out of a feeling that New Deal liberalism had run out of gas and was no longer working for them.

In the decades since, the economic picture for the working class has been mixed. The economic growth set off by the Reagan Revolution has, in fact, been good for a swath of American workers. Median household income has risen dramatically, to $70,784 in 2021 from $55,828 in 1984 in inflation-adjusted dollars, according to data from the St. Louis Fed.

At the same time, though, the manufacturing jobs that long had been the backbone of the working-class economy have been drying up, falling by 23% in the last three decades.

Meanwhile, the new globalized, tech-driven economy has produced growing income inequality between those at the top of the economic ladder and workers in the middle. Between 1980 and 2021, the gap between median income for those in the 90th percentile of American earners and those in the middle 50th percentile grew by 29%.

These trend lines have left many in the working class questioning both parties. Democrats¡¯ traditional grip on the working class has loosened as the base of the party has shifted to wealthier, better-educated, socially liberal constituencies on the coasts. Ruy Teixeira, a political analyst who has long chronicled the political path of American workers, wrote a piece in the Atlantic just before last fall¡¯s midterm elections titled ¡°Democrats¡¯ Long Goodbye to the Working Class.¡± He says in an interview: ¡°We now have a situation where the Democrats regularly lose the working class vote.¡±

Rep. Debbie Dingell, a Democrat representing Michigan¡¯s sixth district stretching west and south of Detroit, acknowledges that Mr. Trump ¡°recognized the anxiety of people who¡®d just seen their jobs go overseas and were worried about their retirement.¡±

But she also says that, under the Biden administration, Democratic policies have begun to reverse the trend lines, by spending billions of dollars on jobs improving U.S. infrastructure, creating clean-energy jobs and mounting efforts to bring back to the U.S. factories making, among other things, computer chips.

Rep. Dingell is launching within the House a new ¡°Heartland Caucus,¡± a coalition of Democrats focused on advancing policies to benefit Americans residing in the broad center of the country. She frames that effort as part of a needed push by Democrats to reconnect with working-class voters, in workplaces as well as farms. ¡°We have not lost them, but we have to remind them that we¡¯re fighting for them,¡± she says. ¡°We need to be in those union halls, we need to be on those family farms, we need to be in those veterans¡¯ centers.¡±

On the Republican side, new-wave conservatives argue that Republicans have lost their way by expecting markets to work economic magic and by failing to acknowledge that market forces have been distorted by foreign competitors, particularly China.

Oren Cass, executive director of American Compass, a policy center that is in the forefront of rethinking traditional conservative economic ideas, says that the key for Republicans now is focusing on raising wages and ¡°throwing out the supply-side conceit that if we make things better for capital and those with high incomes, everything will be better.¡±

Mr. Cass says it is noteworthy that this new conservative economic movement doesn¡¯t automatically put individual tax cuts at the top of the priority list, as was long the case for Republicans. The flaws of that approach, he argues, were illustrated by the disaster that befell former British Prime Minister Liz Truss when she put forth a traditional, aggressive tax-cutting program only to see it lead to economic calamity and her rapid downfall.

Mr. Cass has worked with Sen. Cotton on his proposal for government-assisted workplace training and argues that Republicans can empower workers outside of the traditional big unions that Democrats support by prodding companies to put worker representatives on their boards. He also hopes recent legislation to boost domestic computer-chip production will be followed by similar measures to create incentives for American production of rare-earth minerals, electric-vehicle batteries and pharmaceutical components.

In a similar vein, Rep. Jim Banks, a leader of the House¡¯s conservative Republican Study Committee, argued in a memo to Mr. McCarthy during the last Congress that Republicans should reverse their embrace of globalism. ¡°For far too long,¡± he wrote, ¡°both parties supported outsourcing working-class jobs overseas in the name of economic growth.¡±

Sen. Rubio, meantime, chides big corporations not only for shipping jobs overseas but also for embracing ¡°woke¡± social views of the liberal left. He calls for a set of policies that penalize firms and investors that make certain investments in China and reward those who bring capital back to the U.S.

All this is enough of a departure from the past that it leaves some Republicans worried that their party is drifting toward mimicking Democratic reliance on government solutions and abandoning principles that have brought great electoral success.

¡°We have to get back to the basic principles of Reagan and Bush and build upon them, and add to those the questions of crime, education and, of course, inflation,¡± says Frank Fahrenkopf, a former national chairman of the Republican party.

The most difficult internal GOP debate may come on the question of entitlements?specifically the Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid programs that make up a growing piece of the federal spending.

In the prolonged House debate over choosing a new speaker, lawmakers frequently bemoaned the rising federal debt and the spending that is driving that debt, framing the problem as a kind of national crisis. And those opposing Mr. McCarthy as speaker used their leverage to force into place procedures that will make it easier for them to compel big, across-the-board spending cuts to handle the problem.

That at least implies a willingness to curb the big entitlement programs as part of the corrective effort. Sen. Hawley argues that would be a mistake. ¡°I would warn against immediately going to working-class people and saying, ¡®The Social Security and Medicare benefits you have been paying for is where we are going to go first.¡¯¡±

A dispute among a group of teenagers had escalated into gunfire on Sept. 7, a few weeks into the start of the school year. The injured boy, who couldn¡¯t speak, wrote down a question to Marrero: ¡°Why did I get shot?¡±

The 40-year-old schools chief had left New York to take the job in 2021, accepting responsibility for the instruction and safety of nearly 90,000 students. ¡°I felt like I had failed for the first time as an educator,¡± he said about the boy.

Denver school authorities would by the end of the school year catch 16 students around the city bringing guns to campus, a five-year high. The district¡¯s board of education had decided to remove Denver police officers from campuses the year before Marrero arrived. He wondered what it would take for them to change their mind.

The boy¡¯s shooting was the first act of violence that marked two turbulent semesters at East High, the district¡¯s flagship campus. The school occupies a century-old four-story brick building, where hallways are lined with state championship trophies, academic honors and photos of famous alumni, including Don Cheadle and members of the musical group Earth, Wind & Fire.

By spring, fears among teachers, students and parents erupted at town-hall and school board meetings. Again and again, one issue stood above all, dividing the community: Please bring back campus police. On the other side: Please, no police.

¡°You expect them to come in here and still be focused? How?¡± Wilisha Askew, the parent of an East High sophomore, said during one meeting. ¡°They¡¯re going through too much. My kid can¡¯t sleep. I¡¯m going through nightmares at my house right now.¡±  

After the killing of George Floyd in 2020, the school board in a unanimous vote removed the district¡¯s 17 Denver Police Department officers from their posts at 18 middle- and high-school campuses. More than three dozen school districts around the U.S. also ended school-policing programs.

The Denver board made its decision at a time of nationwide protests over police mistreatment of people of color. Parents and others who backed the school police ban said they believed officers unfairly targeted Black and Latino students, a group comprising around two-thirds of the district¡¯s student body.

Some still opposed the return of armed officers. ¡°We cannot think of a model that has existed in the United States of America, where police have been a benefit to the Black community,¡± Robert Davis, a public safety-reform advocate, said at a meeting convened by Marrero.

Less than two weeks after the 14-year-old was shot, a recording over the intercom interrupted afternoon classes at East High to announce a lockdown. A call to police had reported a shooter on the third floor.

Students and teachers huddled in the corners of locked classrooms with the lights off. ¡°I¡¯m freaking out,¡± freshman Norah Krause texted her best friend, crouching among the cellos and basses in the orchestra storage room. ¡°If anything happens, I love you.¡±

Police, some in helmets and body armor, went from room to room, pointing guns and ordering students to leave with their hands up. It turned out to be a hoax.

Marrero, a Bronx-raised son of a Cuban refugee and a Dominican immigrant, had for months been considering the return of police to Denver campuses. Nationwide, gun violence among young people has been increasing since the pandemic.

He told the board in November that in the absence of a plan to shield schools from gun violence?and without help from the city?someone was bound to be killed.

¡°This is, pardon the pun, a ticking time bomb,¡± he told the board.

Marrero would later be asked to come up with a safety plan. He would have until June.
Wrong place, wrong time

During first period on Feb. 13, Luis Garcia stood in front of his honors Hispanic Literature class. The East High junior was a member of the varsity soccer team that won the state championship in the fall. He read a poem to the class he had written about Denver.

¡°My city is the sound of gunshots/ And acts of violence all around,¡± part of the poem says. ¡°Its getting shot just cuz you were at the wrong place wrong time.¡±

The school, hailed for its academics, enrolled around 2,500 students, drawn from families of all incomes this year?52% of them white, 22% Hispanic, 14% Black and 3% Asian.

Later in the day, a recording boomed over the intercom, ordering students to stay in their classrooms. A student had been shot while sitting in a car by the school. It was Luis. He died two weeks later. There have been no arrests, police said, and the investigation continues.

On March 3, two days after Luis¡¯s death, hundreds of East High students marched a mile-and-a-half to the state Capitol, demanding an end to gun violence. They voiced support for bills that would raise the minimum age to buy a firearm to 21 from 18, among other measures.

¡°Go to the source,¡± Norah, the East High freshman, said at one student rally. ¡°The source is the guns.¡± Police on campus, she said, isn¡¯t enough.

East High teachers demanded board action. ¡°What actual steps will you take to keep guns out of our schools?¡± Charlie Gaare, a longtime English teacher there, wrote in an email to board Vice President Auon¡¯tai Anderson after Luis¡¯s killing.

Anderson replied that the board had called on lawmakers to pass gun-control legislation. School police, he wrote, aren¡¯t coming back to East or any campus.

Four days after Luis¡¯s funeral, on the morning of March 22, Marrero was on a Zoom call with Denver Police Chief Ron Thomas. They were kicking around the idea of a citywide billboard campaign to try to build trust between police and students.

A staff member threw open the door of Marrero¡¯s office. ¡°Shots fired at East!¡± he said.
Call for help

Austin Lyle, 17, had been expelled from another school district and was allowed to attend East High on the condition that he get searched by a staff member every morning before class. 

Shortly after he walked into the school building that day, Jerald ¡°Wayne¡± Mason, a school dean, got a call for help on his walkie-talkie. He ran into an office and saw Austin grappling with another dean, who yelled, ¡°Gun! Gun!¡±

Austin shot both of the deans and ran out. Steps away, students filled the auditorium for an assembly. The two wounded men were taken to the hospital. Austin¡¯s body was later found in the mountains outside of Denver. Authorities said he shot himself. 

At a news conference at the high school that day, Marrero stood beside the police chief and Denver Mayor Michael Hancock to announce that two armed officers would be assigned to the East High campus until the end of the school year.

Marrero then headed to the same hospital where he had gone to see Luis and the 14-year-old boy shot in September. In a waiting room, Mason¡¯s sister shouted at him. She said her brother knew it was a mistake to remove police from campus, Marrero recalled. She demanded to know what he planned to do now.

Later that day, Marrero sent a letter to the board, saying armed officers would be placed at Denver public high schools until summer. He acknowledged his decision contradicted the school board¡¯s policy. But the shootings changed everything, he said.

¡°These events should not have happened on my watch or on this Board¡¯s watch,¡± he wrote.

The board directed Marrero to offer a safety plan by the end of June and agreed to temporarily rescind their ban on school police. 
Human shield

Heated arguments about how best to protect students and teachers spread citywide.

At a community meeting in the East High auditorium, Marrero told the crowd that a safety plan was in the works. He acknowledged the district should have held community meetings after the first or second campus incident, and angry parents cut him off. ¡°Third!¡± parents yelled. ¡°Fourth!¡±

They asked about metal detectors and wanted to know why students expelled elsewhere were allowed to transfer to Denver public schools.

Parents organized a 1,200-member group and began holding weekly news conferences to push for stronger safety measures. They brought in a metal detector to display and invited security experts to speak.

Luis¡¯s family spoke in support of returning officers to schools during a news conference organized by the parents. ¡°We don¡¯t want 100, 200 policemen,¡± said Santos Garcia, the father of the boy who was killed. ¡°But we want a little security so the students feel safe.¡±

East High teachers, including Gaare, brought Marrero their own list of demands: Restrict entry to campus. Provide information about students considered a safety threat. Offer better mental-health support for the staff. 

When the deans were shot, Gaare imagined having to protect her students, at the risk of leaving her 4-year-old son an orphan. ¡°I have to be a human shield?¡± she said.

Early in May, Marrero released a draft of a new safety plan. It recommended that schools decide whether to station police on campus. The principals¡¯ union urged adoption instead of a single districtwide policy, rather than leave the decision to individual schools. Marrero invited a group of teachers, principals and students to debate the plan during meetings at district headquarters.

Chi Onyewuenyi, an elementary-school teacher who is Black and has four children, said she worried about school police barging into every student-teacher exchange. Yet as a teacher, she said, she was tired of being scared. Past tensions between armed officers and minority students could, with clear guidance, be worked out in the interests of safety, she said.

¡°We can change it,¡± she told the group. ¡°We can be at the forefront.¡±

Marrero released a second draft of the plan before the Memorial Day weekend, which said that the board needed to make a decision about returning police districtwide.

Thomas, the police chief and a Denver public school graduate, spoke to the school board on June 5. He said campus officers could serve as an opportunity for young people to build trust with police, setting off a tense back-and-forth.

Board member Michelle Quattlebaum dismissed school district data showing overwhelming support among students and staff at high schools for campus police. She said she heard from Black students who had bad experiences with police and said they were afraid to share their opinion.

¡°This topic is too important,¡± Quattlebaum shouted, after board President X?chitl Gayt?n cut off her microphone for speaking out of order. ¡°I will continue to press back on systems and structures of oppression.¡±

School board Vice President Anderson said teacher and principal support for school police didn¡¯t matter because they wouldn¡¯t be the ones who risked arrest. ¡°The Black kids that share my skin will be arrested,¡± he said. ¡°Those are the children I¡¯m looking out for.¡±

Marrero promised that school police wouldn¡¯t target Black and Latino students, and that his administration was particularly sensitive to such worries.

The following week, the board met again. After nearly four hours of debate, they voted 4-3 to bring back campus police, who would be closely monitored by the district.

Marrero said he understood that the school-police decision wouldn¡¯t satisfy everyone, that it wouldn¡¯t completely shield students and staff from violence, that it won¡¯t make everyone feel safe or solve mental-health troubles. Yet the district had to do something, he said.

Denver joined the 10 or more districts that removed school police in recent years and have since reversed course. Of the four Denver board members who backed the return of school police, two had supported the 2020 ban.

Scott Baldermann, who voted with the majority, was one of the board members who changed his mind. ¡°If it stops one kid from bringing a loaded gun into a school,¡± he said, ¡°I think it¡¯s worth it.¡±",WSJ

Interspersed among mass shootings in Texas and elsewhere, descriptions have emerged from prosecutors of the alleged Massachusetts National Guard intelligence leaker, Jack Teixeira. He is reported to have participated in a pestilential online gun culture, replete with tasteless japing about mass shootings.

When Democrats have drummed up the votes to disarm Americans or significantly impede their ability to buy guns, text me. But we live in a society where speech is also free, including freedom to organize campaigns against a pernicious strain in the mass-shooter phenomenon. I¡¯m referring to the fetishization of guns that has left so much of the gun culture?once personified in Charlton Heston?in its dust. Representative in reality but increasingly less so in public perception are the majority of capable, responsible gun owners who keep guns for legitimate reasons, use them in disciplined fashion, handle them safely with respect for the people around them.

Who, among these responsible owners, really doubts, as Scientific American put it, that for part of America guns have gone from ¡°utilitarian tools¡± for hunting and self-defense to a form of ¡°psychological solace¡±? Not impossible to envision as a contribution to the mass-shooter problem would be a public campaign to laud responsible ownership and stigmatize the pathetic kind of gun role-playing that festers on the internet and in too much of the industry¡¯s advertising.

Public campaigns have successfully stigmatized driving without seat belts and under the influence. They have stigmatized smoking. The culture has shown it can change fast?see the rise of gay marriage and disappearance of the racial and ethnic joke.

Law-abiding gun enthusiasts, dealers and law enforcement would support a well-targeted campaign that could stigmatize gun ownership as a form of compensation for personal inadequacy or totem of deranged identity politics. Reframe an exhibitionist identification with guns unmistakably as an admission of personal weakness, overcompensation, the need for therapy. Let Adam Lanza, the adolescent schlub behind the Newtown elementary-school massacre, be the poster boy.

Alas, akin to activists who lose interest in addressing mudslides if the solution doesn¡¯t involve banning fossil fuels, the biggest obstacle may be the antigun activists. If guns didn¡¯t exist, no shootings would occur but the easy correlations end there. Numbers of guns in the public¡¯s possession may correlate with accidental shootings and firearm suicides, but gun homicides relate more to independent patterns of criminal activity (such as the rise and fall of the crack wars) while statement-style mass shootings seem mainly to correlate with themselves, as acts with a large copycat element.

Ruthlessly, don¡¯t let a gun-awareness campaign become a vehicle for standard liberal tropes and narratives. Leave out the alleged connections to white supremacy, leave out the general disdain for rural Americans, people who didn¡¯t go to college, Trump voters, gender traditionalists, religious believers.

Anything else would defeat the point and tragically miss an opportunity to do some good by drawing a line between responsible and irresponsible gun cultures. Do I have confidence in our governing elites? Could the Biden administration consummate this easy layup without succumbing to the partisan opportunists that Mr. Biden has surrendered so much of his agenda to?

Remember, the goal is not to express the general public¡¯s sane horror at mass shootings. The goal is to stigmatize irresponsible attitudes and patterns of thinking about guns. This means holding up responsible gun ownership and responsible gun handling as virtues, qualities to be admired and emulated by aspiring gun fans. University of Arizona researcher Jennifer Carlson has done as much as anyone to plumb the beliefs of gun owners. Many are liberals, most turn out to be better-than-average citizens by many measures, and yet it¡¯s impossible to ignore that for a subset guns have become a prop to compensate for deepening social and personal failures.

We come to a second point. People who attach themselves to guns as a form of psychological self-medication also tend to advertise themselves on social media, make threats, flaunt their pathologies. After many shootings, the red flags turn out to have been numerous.

Not only is gun fetishization a demonstrated risk factor, it¡¯s a ripe bogey for law-enforcement algorithms aimed at interrupting mass shootings in the planning stages. I¡¯ve made the point often enough: With sufficient will, safeguards could be built in. In any case, surveillance technology is pervading our society. It will be used for everything else except protecting us from terrorism-minded criminals unless we tackle the unavoidable necessity of constraining and adapting these technologies to a democratic society.",WSJ

In recent years that¡¯s changed. As Republicans have shifted to the right on some of these issues, the country¡¯s moral center?characterized by moderation, decency and respect for others?has asserted itself against the GOP¡¯s excesses.

That doesn¡¯t mean Democrats have been given a pass for their own transgressions. When they have gone too far in areas such as crime (¡°defund the police¡±), immigration (¡°abolish ICE¡±), and restraints on speech (cancel culture), voters have rebuked them, and candidates have been forced to choose between ideological purity and political viability.

U.S. voters are looking for candidates willing to defend what most see as moral common sense and recognize that complex cultural issues can¡¯t be reduced to a binary choice.

In the mid-1990s, 70% of Americans opposed legal recognition for same-sex marriage. A quarter-century later, 70% favor it, including most Republicans. Conservatives did themselves no favors by continuing to oppose it long after it became clear that the people had decided and weren¡¯t likely to turn back. Legislating new legal restrictions is out of the question. If the Supreme Court reversed its 2015 decision giving constitutional protection to same-sex marriage, public regard for the court, which fell sharply after it overturned Roe v. Wade, would collapse.

After Dobbs v. Jackson Women¡¯s Health Organization, some Republican leaders advocated a national abortion ban while others pushed for tough state laws. The backlash was swift and powerful, and deep divisions have emerged within conservative ranks. In the past week, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, a candidate for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, went on national television to warn her party that a national ban is a political fantasy. At the same time, Donald Trump, suggested that the ban on abortions after six weeks that Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis had signed into law is ¡°too harsh.¡±

Republicans are finding out the hard way that Roe¡¯s trimester formula blended permission and restraint in a manner that more than 60% of Americans could accept, whatever their misgivings. If the party were smart, its candidates for national office would train their fire on late-term abortions, which are far less popular than those earlier in pregnancy; support the rights of states to make their own abortion policies; and refrain from advocating additional restraints on the availability of the abortion pill mifepristone.

Guns offer another example of emerging possibilities for moderate approaches. Although the people have long supported what they regard as reasonable restraints on gun ownership and use, the minority of Americans who fervently oppose such restraints have dominated the politics of the issue. But there are signs that the spate of mass shootings in schools, churches and public spaces is shifting the balance.

In Tennessee, which Mr. Trump carried by 23 points in 2020, Republican Gov. Bill Lee signed an executive order tightening background checks and began pushing for a law permitting judges to confiscate weapons from people deemed to be threats to themselves or others. In Texas, some staunch pro-gun legislators astounded observers by backing a measure to raise the age at which young adults could buy assault-style weapons. After the vote, one of them said that ¡°shootings right now are just happening too often.¡± The American people agree, and they want their elected officials to do something about it. If President Biden were to propose a ban on assault-style weapons for persons under 21, he would find a receptive audience among swing voters.

Even on emerging cultural issues such as the treatment of transgender people, most Americans see the need for nuance. In a recent survey, 57% agreed that ¡°whether someone is a man or a woman is determined by the sex they were assigned at birth,¡± and more than 60% say that trans women and girls shouldn¡¯t be allowed to compete in sports with other women and girls. Yet supermajorities support laws protecting trans people from discrimination in housing, employment, education, healthcare and the military.

Another emerging issue illustrating this pattern is the debate about public education that has figured prominently in Virginia and Florida and has prompted a surge of grass-roots activism in much of the country. Americans reject the proposition that parents should have no say in the content used to educate their children, and they oppose exposing grade-school children to discussions of abortion, homosexuality and transgender issues. They are, however, open to such discussions for high-school students and oppose removing books on these topics from school libraries. Huge majorities support courses in U.S. history that talk honestly about our worst mistakes as well as our greatest achievements.

The candidate who best expresses Americans¡¯ yearning for cultural moderation and common sense will have a huge advantage in next year¡¯s presidential contest. ",WSJ

Hawaii¡¯s Supreme Court hears oral arguments Thursday in Honolulu v. Sunoco, a lawsuit brought by the state¡¯s largest city against a group of energy companies. Honolulu alleges that the defendants have created a ¡°public nuisance¡± by producing fossil fuels that emit greenhouse gases when burned. The companies argue that they are already subject to federal regulation, which supersedes any claim under state law.

Activist groups are increasingly attempting to use public-nuisance lawsuits to impose policies that they¡¯ve failed to persuade lawmakers to enact. The list of industries under assault is long and growing. One set of public-nuisance actions targets firearm manufacturers. It was launched on behalf of local governments in New York state by plaintiff lawyers, with the firm Napoli Shkolnik, fresh from a successful action against pharmaceutical companies, serving as lead counsel. Other cases pursue chemical companies for producing so-called forever chemicals, which have been lawfully used for decades in making and packaging countless household and personal-hygiene products.

Public-nuisance lawsuits also attack beverage companies for using plastic bottles, leading to litter on beaches. School districts are suing tech companies claiming that their social-media platforms endanger children. Several cities have sued Hyundai and alleging that certain cars they make are ¡°too easy to steal.¡±

The financial stakes are high. The opioid cases?brought against drug manufacturers, distributors and retail pharmacy chains?have generated more than $55 billion in settlements. (Last week the U.S. Supreme Court stayed a settlement between plaintiffs and bankrupt Purdue Pharma, pending an appeal that the justices will hear in December.) The litigation against ¡°forever chemicals¡± manufacturers, which is still in the early stages, has already led to more than $11 billion in tentative settlements. Given the apocalyptic rhetoric around climate change and gun violence, lawsuits against gun and energy companies, if successful, could yield hundreds of billions of dollars in damages.

Their lawsuits feature profoundly flawed theories of liability that threaten the fabric of U.S. law. Under traditional common law, a paradigmatic public nuisance suit involves clearly unlawful conduct, such as running a brothel or drug house in a residential neighborhood, blocking a public right of way, or operating a factory that emits noxious smells. Defendants in such lawsuits are the agents directly responsible for causing the alleged harm.

These new ideological public-nuisance suits target products or activities that didn¡¯t violate any law or regulation at the time they were produced and used. The defendants are manufacturers and distributors rather than individuals who committed specific wrongful acts. Such claims often feature freestanding state-law causes of action, available to local governments that otherwise lack legal authority to bring other public enforcement actions. That enables plaintiff lawyers, working with local governments, to make an end-run around state governments, pushing ¡°progressive¡± policies, even in conservative states.

As long as the threat of litigation lingers over every industry under the sun, plaintiff lawyers will have the ability to intimidate market participants and reshape the economy without ever scoring a conclusive win in a courtroom (never mind a legislature). Even corporate giants that can afford to fight sometimes find it more economical to settle a meritless claim. Litigation options and their attendant costs are even worse for small and midsize businesses, like local car dealers, gasoline stations and beverage distributors.

There have been some major litigation setbacks to this public-nuisance campaign. In 2021 the Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed a New York City suit against international oil companies that sought to recover, as the court put it, ¡°damages caused by those companies¡¯ admittedly legal commercial conduct in producing and selling fossil fuels around the world.¡± The same year, the Oklahoma Supreme Court tossed an opioid case against .

But because such lawsuits are usually driven by state law, there is no opportunity for a conclusive nationwide win at the U.S. Supreme Court covering all these lawsuits; the battles have to be waged on a state-by-state basis. Federal constitutional issues arise in cases against some industries?the First Amendment for social media, the Second Amendments for gun makers. There are also some instances in which federal common law or regulatory statutes like the Clean Air Act pre-empt the application of state public-nuisance laws. That was the basis on which the Second Circuit threw out the New York case and is one of the key arguments before the Hawaii Supreme Court.

Fortunately, there are other available remedies. State legislatures could bar cities and counties from hiring plaintiff lawyers to prosecute public nuisance suits on a contingency basis, which would constitute an excellent remedial measure. They could also forbid local governments from bringing public-nuisance cases at all, or at least against manufacturers and distributors of products circulating in interstate commerce, or require approval from state officials such as the attorney general.

Conservative states would likely lead the way in enacting such reforms. These public-nuisance lawsuits harm the economy and are antithetical to American democracy, which requires decisions about economic regulation to be made by politically accountable officials, not by courts. And having governmental entities delegate litigation control to plaintiff lawyers amounts to a government-deputized shakedown of disfavored industries.

https://www.nytimes.com/explain/2023/gun-control/what-do-opponents-of-gun-control-argue?searchResultPosition=4,2023-01-26,"Gun Control, Explained","A quick guide to the debate over gun legislation in the United States. By The New York Times As the number of mass shootings in America continues to rise, gun control ? a term used to describe a wide range of restrictions and measures aimed at controlling the use of firearms ? remains at the center of heated discussions among proponents and opponents of stricter gun laws.  To help understand the debate and its political and social implications, we addressed some key questions on the subject.  Is gun control effective? What gun control measures exist at the federal level? What are gun buyback programs and do they work? Where does the U.S. public stand on the issue? What do opponents of gun control argue? Why is it so hard to push for legislation? Throughout the world, mass shootings have frequently been met with a common response: Officials impose new restrictions on gun ownership. Mass shootings become rarer. Homicides and suicides tend to decrease, too. After a British gunman killed 16 people in 1987, the country banned semiautomatic weapons like the ones he had used. It did the same with most handguns after a school shooting in 1996. It now has one of the lowest gun-related death rates in the developed world. In Australia, a 1996 massacre prompted mandatory gun buybacks in which, by some estimates, as many as one million firearms were then melted into slag. The rate of mass shootings plummeted. Only the United States, whose rate and severity of mass shootings is without parallel outside conflict zones, has so consistently refused to respond to those events with tightened gun laws. Several theories to explain the number of shootings in the United States ? like its unusually violent societal, class and racial divides, or its shortcomings in providing mental health care ? have been debunked by research. But one variable remains: the astronomical number of guns in the country. America¡¯s gun homicide rate was 33 per one million people in 2009, far exceeding the average among developed countries. In Canada and Britain, it was 5 per million and 0.7 per million, respectively, which also corresponds with differences in gun ownership. Americans sometimes see this as an expression of its deeper problems with crime, a notion ingrained, in part, by a series of films portraying urban gang violence in the early 1990s. But the United States is not actually more prone to crime than other developed countries, according to a landmark 1999 study by Franklin E. Zimring and Gordon Hawkins of the University of California, Berkeley. Rather, they found, in data that has since been repeatedly confirmed, that American crime is simply more lethal. A New Yorker is just as likely to be robbed as a Londoner, for instance, but the New Yorker is 54 times more likely to be killed in the process. They concluded that the discrepancy, like so many other anomalies of American violence, came down to guns. More gun ownership corresponds with more gun murders across virtually every axis: among developed countries, among American states, among American towns and cities and when controlling for crime rates. And gun control legislation tends to reduce gun murders, according to a recent analysis of 130 studies from 10 countries. This suggests that the guns themselves cause the violence. ? Max Fisher and Josh Keller, Why Does the U.S. Have So Many Mass Shootings? Research Is Clear: Guns. Every mass shooting is, in some sense, a fringe event, driven by one-off factors like the ideology or personal circumstances of the assailant. The risk is impossible to fully erase. Still, the record is confirmed by reams of studies that have analyzed the effects of policies like Britain¡¯s and Australia¡¯s: When countries tighten gun control laws, it leads to fewer guns in private citizens¡¯ hands, which leads to less gun violence. Much of current federal gun control legislation is a baseline, governing who can buy, sell and use certain classes of firearms, with states left free to enact additional restrictions. Dealers must be licensed, and run background checks to ensure their buyers are not ¡°prohibited persons,¡± including felons or people with a history of domestic violence ? though private sellers at gun shows or online marketplaces are not required to run background checks. Federal law also highly restricts the sale of certain firearms, such as fully automatic rifles. The most recent federal legislation, a bipartisan effort passed last year after a gunman killed 19 children and two teachers at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, expanded background checks for buyers under 21 and closed what is known as the boyfriend loophole. It also strengthened existing bans on gun trafficking and straw purchasing. ? Aishvarya Kavi Gun buyback programs are short-term initiatives that provide incentives, such as money or gift cards, to convince people to surrender firearms to law enforcement, typically with no questions asked. These events are often held by governments or private groups at police stations, houses of worship and community centers. Guns that are collected are either destroyed or stored. Most programs strive to take guns off the streets, provide a safe place for firearm disposal and stir cultural changes in a community, according to Gun by Gun, a nonprofit dedicated to preventing gun violence. The first formal gun buyback program was held in Baltimore in 1974 after three police officers were shot and killed, according to the authors of the book ¡°Why We Are Losing the War on Gun Violence in the United States.¡± The initiative collected more than 13,000 firearms, but failed to reduce gun violence in the city. Hundreds of other buyback programs have since unfolded across the United States. In 1999, President Bill Clinton announced the nation¡¯s first federal gun buyback program. The $15 million program provided grants of up to $500,000 to police departments to buy and destroy firearms. Two years later, the Senate defeated efforts to extend financing for the program after the Bush administration called for it to end. Despite the popularity of gun buyback programs among certain anti-violence and anti-gun advocates, there is little data to suggest that they work. A study by the National Bureau of Economic Research, a private nonprofit, found that buyback programs adopted in U.S. cities were ineffective in deterring gun crime, firearm-related homicides or firearm-related suicides.  . Evidence showed that cities set the sale price of a firearm too low to considerably reduce the supply of weapons; most who participated in such initiatives came from low-crime areas and firearms that were typically collected were either older or not in good working order. Dr. Brendan Campbell, a pediatric surgeon at Connecticut Children¡¯s Medical Center and an author of one chapter in ¡°Why We Are Losing the War on Gun Violence in the United States,¡± said that buyback programs should collect significantly more firearms than they currently do in order to be more effective. Dr. Campbell said they should also offer higher prices for handguns and assault rifles. ¡°Those are the ones that are most likely to be used in crime,¡± and by people attempting suicide, he said. ¡°If you just give $100 for whatever gun, that¡¯s when you¡¯ll end up with all these old, rusted guns that are a low risk of causing harm in the community.¡± Mandatory buyback programs have been enacted elsewhere around the world. After a mass shooting in 1996, Australia put in place a nationwide buyback program, collecting somewhere between one in five and one in three privately held guns. The initiative mostly targeted semiautomatic rifles and many shotguns that, under new laws, were no longer permitted. New Zealand banned military-style semiautomatic weapons, assault rifles and some gun parts and began its own large-scale buyback program in 2019, after a terrorist attack on mosques in Christchurch. The authorities said that more than 56,000 prohibited firearms had been collected from about 32,000 people through the initiative. Expanded background checks for guns purchased routinely receive more than 80 or 90 percent support in polling. Nationally, a majority of Americans have supported stricter gun laws for decades. A Gallup poll conducted in June found that 55 percent of participants were in favor of a ban on the manufacture, possession and sale of semiautomatic guns. A majority of respondents also supported other measures, including raising the legal age at which people can purchase certain firearms, and enacting a 30-day waiting period for gun sales. But the jumps in demand for gun control that occur after mass shootings also tend to revert to the partisan mean as time passes. Gallup poll data shows that the percentage of participants who supported stricter gun laws receded to 57 percent in October from 66 percent in June, which was just weeks after mass shootings in Uvalde, Texas, and Buffalo. A PDK poll conducted after the shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde found that 72 percent of Republicans supported arming teachers, in contrast with 24 percent of Democrats. Opponents of gun control, including most Republican members of Congress, argue that proposals to limit access to firearms infringe on the right of citizens to bear arms enshrined in the Second Amendment to the Constitution. And they contend that mass shootings are not the result of easily accessible guns, but of criminals and mentally ill people bent on waging violence. ? Annie Karni Polling suggests that Americans broadly support gun control measures, yet legislation is often stymied in Washington, and Republicans rarely seem to pay a political price for their opposition. The calculation behind Republicans¡¯ steadfast stonewalling of any new gun regulations ? even in the face of the kind unthinkable massacres like in Uvalde, Texas ? is a fairly simple one for Senator Kevin Cramer of North Dakota. Asked what the reaction would be from voters back home if he were to support any significant form of gun control, the first-term Republican had a straightforward answer: ¡°Most would probably throw me out of office,¡± he said. His response helps explain why Republicans have resisted proposals such as the one for universal background checks for gun buyers, despite remarkably broad support from the public for such plans ? support that can reach up to 90 percent nationwide in some cases. Republicans like Mr. Cramer understand that they would receive little political reward for joining the push for laws to limit access to guns, including assault-style weapons. But they know for certain that they would be pounded ? and most likely left facing a primary opponent who could cost them their job ? for voting for gun safety laws or even voicing support for them. Most Republicans in the Senate represent deeply conservative states where gun ownership is treated as a sacred privilege enshrined in the Constitution, a privilege not to be infringed upon no matter how much blood is spilled in classrooms and school hallways around the country. Though the National Rifle Association has recently been diminished by scandal and financial turmoil, Democrats say that the organization still has a strong hold on Republicans through its financial contributions and support, hardening the party¡¯s resistance to any new gun laws. ? Carl Hulse, ¡°Why Republicans Won¡¯t Budge on Guns.¡± Yet while the power of the gun lobby, the outsize influence of rural states in the Senate and single-voter issues offer some explanation, there is another possibility: voters. When voters in four Democratic-leaning states got the opportunity to enact expanded gun or ammunition background checks into law, the overwhelming support suggested by national surveys was nowhere to be found. For Democrats, the story is both unsettling and familiar. Progressives have long been emboldened by national survey results that show overwhelming support for their policy priorities, only to find they don¡¯t necessarily translate to Washington legislation and to popularity on Election Day or beyond. President Biden¡¯s major policy initiatives are popular, for example, yet voters say he has not accomplished much and his approval ratings have sunk into the low 40s.The apparent progressive political majority in the polls might just be illusory. Public support for new gun restrictions tends to rise in the wake of mass shootings. There is already evidence that public support for stricter gun laws has surged again in the aftermath of the killings in Buffalo and Uvalde, Texas. While the public¡¯s support for new restrictions tends to subside thereafter, these shootings or another could still produce a lasting shift in public opinion. But the poor results for background checks suggest that public opinion may not be the unequivocal ally of gun control that the polling makes it seem. ? Nate Cohn, ¡°Voters Say They Want Gun Control.

The Republican supermajority called an end to it on Tuesday without enacting major policy changes. By Emily Cochrane Emily Cochrane, who lives in Nashville and covers the American South, has reported on the Covenant School shooting and its aftermath. Tennessee Republicans on Tuesday ended a special session of the state legislature devoted to public safety without passing any new restrictions on firearm access, bringing to a close an emotional and chaotic week that was punctuated by tearful pleas from parents whose children survived a mass shooting at a Nashville Christian school. The special session, ordered by Gov. Bill Lee, a Republican, over objections from within his own party, had ostensibly been an opportunity for lawmakers to help prevent a repeat of the violence at the Covenant School, where three students and three adults were killed. But it instead offered a bitter epilogue to the vitriolic final weeks of the regular session in April, during which the Republican supermajority ignored thousands of protesters calling for modest gun control and then expelled two Black Democrats for leading a protest from the House floor. The special session concluded with a heated scuffle on the House floor, as those two Democrats ? Representatives Justin Jones and Justin J. Pearson ? confronted Speaker Cameron Sexton as he began to leave the chamber. Mr. Pearson and Mr. Sexton collided with each other in the crowd, and tempers flared as lawmakers traded accusations of intentional shoving. ¡°I don't care what political side you¡¯re on,¡± Mary Joyce, a Covenant parent, said after the legislature had adjourned, her voice raw with tears and anger. ¡°These are our children.¡± House Republicans had begun the special session by muscling through new rules of conduct that would allow them to silence any member deemed to have repeatedly spoken out of turn or off topic. On Monday, that rule was used to silence Mr. Jones, sparking an outcry. Republicans also enacted a ban on signs ? already limited to the size of a sheet of printer paper ? that led to a few women being escorted out for holding signs. The women sued on First Amendment grounds, and a Nashville court overturned the ban. The crackdown on dissent further inflamed tensions over the special session, which Democrats had dismissed as inadequate and conservative Republicans had resisted as a possible infringement on the constitutional rights of gun owners. And it left a core group of Covenant School parents ? speaking for themselves, their children and the parents of the three 9-year-olds who were killed ? to spend day after day publicly reliving the trauma of the attack. Mr. Lee, who lost two family friends in the shooting, had called for an order of protection law that would temporarily allow firearms to be confiscated from those deemed by a court to be a threat to themselves or others. Democrats and experts had pushed for far tougher legislation, while the parents braced themselves for only modest success. But Senate Republicans quickly shelved all but a few bills. They gaveled in and out of committees in just minutes with little debate and refused to take up most legislation. House Republicans, while willing to consider more legislation, panned any firearm restriction proposals and focused on other mental health bills and a push to toughen juvenile crime sentencing.  And both chambers rejected calls from Democrats to address gun violence, the leading cause of death for children in the United States. ¡°I think it¡¯s good to remember that Tennessee is not just Nashville, Tennessee is not just Memphis,¡± said State Representative Jeremy Faison, a member of the House Republican leadership. He added, ¡°There¡¯s literally no one in my district asking me to do anything like what they asked.¡± Ultimately, after barely six days of work, the legislature sent Mr. Lee just a few policy bills, some of which codified existing policy in Tennessee, including measures that would require the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation to produce a comprehensive report on human trafficking, ensure faster updates to the state¡¯s background check system and provide incentives for the safe storage of guns at home. They also approved a funding bill to shore up some mental health and security resources. ¡°We should recognize the significance of this special session ? we made progress in public safety,¡± Mr. Lee told reporters. ¡°And we elevated a conversation about public safety that will continue into the future.¡± Lt. Gov. Randy McNally defended the session as a success, saying that ¡°these things take time¡± and that more work could be done when the legislature returned in January. The session began last week with the deep divide on guns on clear display. Protesters wearing the orange and red associated with gun control advocacy converged on the legislature. Gun rights groups showed up, too, as did a handful of the far-right Proud Boys, their faces largely shrouded as they argued with protesters. Each time a meeting wrapped up without action on gun control, protesters would break into shouts, warning Republicans about primary challengers and yelling through tears about their anger, grief and disappointment. The temporary ban on signs led several to scrawl slogans on their arms, hands and clothing, or to hold their phones high to display flashing phrases. But with the legislature unwilling to consider the tougher proposals they had spent the summer lobbying for, the Covenant parents quietly shifted the focus of their resolve. One unexpectedly difficult victory was for a few mothers, pleading through sobs for the chance to be heard, to testify about their community¡¯s experiences ? an opportunity that was jeopardized at least twice after Republicans cleared the room or sought to cut debate short. (At least one lawmaker later apologized.) The women then described what had happened at Covenant on March 27. How teachers, with shaking hands, barely had time to lock classroom doors. How one teacher persuaded a pre-K class to race, as a way to give running to safety the appearance of a game. How William Kinney, 9, a proud line leader, had moved to lead his class through what they thought was a fire drill, only to be caught in the gunfire that had set off the alarm. Setting aside ambitions for tougher gun control until the regular session in January, the parents urged the adoption of legislation that, after what happened to the third grade class, would help establish new practices to differentiate between a fire drill and an unexpected emergency fire alarm. They also pushed for a measure that would exempt the autopsies and medical examiner reports of children killed in homicides from public records law without parental permission. Yet with senators opposed, both measures failed to make it out of the legislature. As the session dragged on, the parents grew increasingly frustrated and angry, rallying around an impromptu pledge to make lawmakers ¡°get used to seeing these faces¡± by returning again and again to the legislature. But on Tuesday, several mothers broke down into tears of exhaustion and anger, as there was little to show for their weeks of lobbying and work. In front of a closed House chamber, they gathered with Mr. Pearson and other Democrats and prayed ? for strength and for love.

By Emily Cochrane NASHVILLE ? As teenagers and demonstrators flooded the Tennessee state legislature last week to call for lawmakers to toughen access to guns after a deadly shooting at a Christian school, three Democrats headed to the well of the House chamber. Holding a hand-drawn sign calling to ¡°protect kids, not guns¡± and speaking through a megaphone, State Representatives Justin Jones, Justin J. Pearson and Gloria Johnson led chants and called on their colleagues to pass stricter gun laws, forcing the legislative proceedings to a temporary halt. Now, in what would be an extraordinary act of retribution for the protest, Republicans are poised to vote on Thursday to oust the three Democrats from the General Assembly and carry out the first partisan expulsion in the state¡¯s modern history. The House of Representatives has voted only twice since the Civil War to expel a member, once in 1980 after a sitting lawmaker was convicted of soliciting a bribe and again in 2016 after the House majority whip faced allegations of sexual misconduct while in office. Despite the absence of any criminal charges or investigation, Republicans argue that the expulsions are warranted because the protest flouted the rules of procedure and decorum, with the House speaker going so far as to invoke the violence of the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol. And with Republicans holding a supermajority that provides the necessary two-thirds majority for expulsion, Democrats have little recourse to stop the vote. The three lawmakers, who represent districts in the state¡¯s three largest cities, have already lost ID access to the State Capitol and have been stripped of any committee assignments they had. Thursday¡¯s vote comes as the Republican-dominated legislature has remained largely unmoved by thousands of protesters calling for tighter gun laws after a former student killed three 9-year-olds and three adults at the Covenant School on March 27. Senior Republicans have said that they will punt most legislation dealing with guns to 2024, though some conservative lawmakers have signaled an openness to measures that would allow the authorities to confiscate guns from those who are deemed by a judge to be at risk of harming themselves or others. The expected votes also highlight the bitter tensions between hard-line conservatives from rural districts and increasingly marginalized city liberals, after months of the legislature gerrymandering Democratic-leaning areas and muscling through conservative priorities, including measures aimed at limiting the rights of L.G.B.T.Q. people in the state. In interviews on Wednesday, the three Democrats did not rule out the possibility of legal challenges. They will also retain the ability to run for their seats in special elections should they be expelled from the legislature. Even as they acknowledged violating House rules by speaking out of turn, the Democrats warned that after recent instances in which the state legislature was reluctant to expel colleagues facing accusations of misconduct or criminal charges, such a vote was an affront to their constituents, who will temporarily lose representation in the legislature. ¡°They¡¯re trying to silence the voice of the people that have different ideas in them, and to me that¡¯s incredibly scary,¡± said Ms. Johnson, who represents parts of Knoxville. ¡°That is going to have a chilling effect, not only on the people in Tennessee, but across the country, when they see in the states with supermajorities that they can just expel members for a few minutes of speaking when they don¡¯t have permission.¡± Mr. Jones, a longtime community organizer in Nashville, had become a familiar presence among sit-ins and protests at the State Capitol before his election and once faced a temporary ban from the building after the police said he threw a cup of liquid toward a lawmaker while protesting the display of a bust of a Confederate general.  ¡°My community is still grieving here in Nashville,¡± Mr. Jones said. ¡°And a week after this mass shooting, the first major action from the Republican supermajority is to expel and oust three of us for demanding action on gun violence.¡± In resolutions filed separately for each lawmaker, Republicans charge that the lawmaker ¡°did knowingly and intentionally bring disorder and dishonor¡± to the House and ¡°generally engaged in disorderly and disruptive conduct.¡± The measures do not cite any other consequence of the protests. Appearing on a radio show last week, Speaker Cameron Sexton invoked the riot at the U.S. Capitol in 2021 when describing the protests in Nashville, which consisted of a peaceful crowd of teenagers and demonstrators. Mr. Sexton later said he was referring only to the three lawmakers in his comparisons to the mob of rioters that tried to stop the certification of the presidential election. ¡°Their actions are and will always be unacceptable, and they break several rules of decorum and procedure on the House floor,¡± Mr. Sexton said in a statement this week. ¡°Their actions and beliefs that they could be arrested on the House floor were an effort, unfortunately, to make themselves the victims.¡± By Monday afternoon, he had revoked the lawmakers¡¯ ID access that allows them into the building after hours and stripped two of the lawmakers ? Ms. Johnson and Mr. Jones ? of their committee assignments. Mr. Pearson, having barely begun his tenure after winning a special election for a Memphis district in late January, had not yet received a spot on a committee. ¡°We have to think about the power of peaceful protests to help create change, and to say that our peaceful protest deserves our expulsion because we were advocating for gun laws and gun control is just asinine,¡± Mr. Pearson said. In a letter to his colleagues, he defended his actions and declared, ¡°if this House decides to expel me for exercising our sacred First Amendment right to help elevate the voices in our community who want to see us act to prevent gun violence, then do as you feel you must.¡± In a series of posts on social media on Wednesday, Ms. Johnson said she was told by top House officials that she would lose her health benefits upon expulsion, unless she chose to resign ahead of the vote. (¡°Heavens to Betsy, all this does not mean I am considering resigning-NEVER,¡± she wrote. ¡°I am ready to have my hearing in the public view.¡±) The retribution has galvanized the hundreds of protesters already frustrated over the inaction on gun laws, with some of them arriving at the State Capitol with signs demanding ¡°justice for the Tennessee Three¡± this week. During a Monday session where chanting in the halls overshadowed the proceedings inside, Republican leaders singled out individual protesters who were yelling out ¡°do your jobs¡± or ¡°cowards¡± to be escorted from the gallery by the police. A procedural vote hours later descended into chaos as the crowd chanted ¡°fascists¡± and a scuffle broke out between lawmakers on the floor. Mr. Jones, filming the proceedings on his phone, said another lawmaker pushed him and took his phone. A spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department confirmed that a police report had been filed for ¡°misdemeanor simple assault for an incident that occurred on the state House floor.¡± Some Republicans outside the legislature have watched the proceedings with slight bewilderment, questioning why the House leaders would choose to target two young Black representatives and one of just 11 women in the 99-seat House over a protest on the chamber floor. ¡°Instead of dealing with the whole gun issue and the red flag issue and other things, we¡¯re worried about three members of the House minority,¡± said Victor Ashe, a former Knoxville mayor, state legislator and an ambassador under the Bush administration. The violations of House rules, he added, ¡°don¡¯t rise even remotely to the level of expulsion.¡± After thousands of students ? many of them not yet old enough to vote ? marched out of class on Monday to call for action on stricter gun laws, demonstrators were expected to return to the Capitol on Thursday and protest the looming expulsion of the three Democrats.

https://www.nytimes.com/explain/2023/gun-control/what-are-gun-buyback-programs-and-do-they-work?searchResultPosition=7,2023-01-26,"Gun Control, Explained","A quick guide to the debate over gun legislation in the United States. By The New York Times As the number of mass shootings in America continues to rise, gun control ? a term used to describe a wide range of restrictions and measures aimed at controlling the use of firearms ? remains at the center of heated discussions among proponents and opponents of stricter gun laws.  To help understand the debate and its political and social implications, we addressed some key questions on the subject.  Is gun control effective? What gun control measures exist at the federal level? What are gun buyback programs and do they work? Where does the U.S. public stand on the issue? What do opponents of gun control argue? Why is it so hard to push for legislation? Throughout the world, mass shootings have frequently been met with a common response: Officials impose new restrictions on gun ownership. Mass shootings become rarer. Homicides and suicides tend to decrease, too. After a British gunman killed 16 people in 1987, the country banned semiautomatic weapons like the ones he had used. It did the same with most handguns after a school shooting in 1996. It now has one of the lowest gun-related death rates in the developed world. In Australia, a 1996 massacre prompted mandatory gun buybacks in which, by some estimates, as many as one million firearms were then melted into slag. The rate of mass shootings plummeted. Only the United States, whose rate and severity of mass shootings is without parallel outside conflict zones, has so consistently refused to respond to those events with tightened gun laws. Several theories to explain the number of shootings in the United States ? like its unusually violent societal, class and racial divides, or its shortcomings in providing mental health care ? have been debunked by research. But one variable remains: the astronomical number of guns in the country. America¡¯s gun homicide rate was 33 per one million people in 2009, far exceeding the average among developed countries. In Canada and Britain, it was 5 per million and 0.7 per million, respectively, which also corresponds with differences in gun ownership. Americans sometimes see this as an expression of its deeper problems with crime, a notion ingrained, in part, by a series of films portraying urban gang violence in the early 1990s. But the United States is not actually more prone to crime than other developed countries, according to a landmark 1999 study by Franklin E. Zimring and Gordon Hawkins of the University of California, Berkeley. Rather, they found, in data that has since been repeatedly confirmed, that American crime is simply more lethal. A New Yorker is just as likely to be robbed as a Londoner, for instance, but the New Yorker is 54 times more likely to be killed in the process. They concluded that the discrepancy, like so many other anomalies of American violence, came down to guns. More gun ownership corresponds with more gun murders across virtually every axis: among developed countries, among American states, among American towns and cities and when controlling for crime rates. And gun control legislation tends to reduce gun murders, according to a recent analysis of 130 studies from 10 countries. This suggests that the guns themselves cause the violence. ? Max Fisher and Josh Keller, Why Does the U.S. Have So Many Mass Shootings? Research Is Clear: Guns. Every mass shooting is, in some sense, a fringe event, driven by one-off factors like the ideology or personal circumstances of the assailant. The risk is impossible to fully erase. Still, the record is confirmed by reams of studies that have analyzed the effects of policies like Britain¡¯s and Australia¡¯s: When countries tighten gun control laws, it leads to fewer guns in private citizens¡¯ hands, which leads to less gun violence. Much of current federal gun control legislation is a baseline, governing who can buy, sell and use certain classes of firearms, with states left free to enact additional restrictions. Dealers must be licensed, and run background checks to ensure their buyers are not ¡°prohibited persons,¡± including felons or people with a history of domestic violence ? though private sellers at gun shows or online marketplaces are not required to run background checks. Federal law also highly restricts the sale of certain firearms, such as fully automatic rifles. The most recent federal legislation, a bipartisan effort passed last year after a gunman killed 19 children and two teachers at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, expanded background checks for buyers under 21 and closed what is known as the boyfriend loophole. It also strengthened existing bans on gun trafficking and straw purchasing. ? Aishvarya Kavi Gun buyback programs are short-term initiatives that provide incentives, such as money or gift cards, to convince people to surrender firearms to law enforcement, typically with no questions asked. These events are often held by governments or private groups at police stations, houses of worship and community centers. Guns that are collected are either destroyed or stored. Most programs strive to take guns off the streets, provide a safe place for firearm disposal and stir cultural changes in a community, according to Gun by Gun, a nonprofit dedicated to preventing gun violence. The first formal gun buyback program was held in Baltimore in 1974 after three police officers were shot and killed, according to the authors of the book ¡°Why We Are Losing the War on Gun Violence in the United States.¡± The initiative collected more than 13,000 firearms, but failed to reduce gun violence in the city. Hundreds of other buyback programs have since unfolded across the United States. In 1999, President Bill Clinton announced the nation¡¯s first federal gun buyback program. The $15 million program provided grants of up to $500,000 to police departments to buy and destroy firearms. Two years later, the Senate defeated efforts to extend financing for the program after the Bush administration called for it to end. Despite the popularity of gun buyback programs among certain anti-violence and anti-gun advocates, there is little data to suggest that they work. A study by the National Bureau of Economic Research, a private nonprofit, found that buyback programs adopted in U.S. cities were ineffective in deterring gun crime, firearm-related homicides or firearm-related suicides.  . Evidence showed that cities set the sale price of a firearm too low to considerably reduce the supply of weapons; most who participated in such initiatives came from low-crime areas and firearms that were typically collected were either older or not in good working order. Dr. Brendan Campbell, a pediatric surgeon at Connecticut Children¡¯s Medical Center and an author of one chapter in ¡°Why We Are Losing the War on Gun Violence in the United States,¡± said that buyback programs should collect significantly more firearms than they currently do in order to be more effective. Dr. Campbell said they should also offer higher prices for handguns and assault rifles. ¡°Those are the ones that are most likely to be used in crime,¡± and by people attempting suicide, he said. ¡°If you just give $100 for whatever gun, that¡¯s when you¡¯ll end up with all these old, rusted guns that are a low risk of causing harm in the community.¡± Mandatory buyback programs have been enacted elsewhere around the world. After a mass shooting in 1996, Australia put in place a nationwide buyback program, collecting somewhere between one in five and one in three privately held guns. The initiative mostly targeted semiautomatic rifles and many shotguns that, under new laws, were no longer permitted. New Zealand banned military-style semiautomatic weapons, assault rifles and some gun parts and began its own large-scale buyback program in 2019, after a terrorist attack on mosques in Christchurch. The authorities said that more than 56,000 prohibited firearms had been collected from about 32,000 people through the initiative. Expanded background checks for guns purchased routinely receive more than 80 or 90 percent support in polling. Nationally, a majority of Americans have supported stricter gun laws for decades. A Gallup poll conducted in June found that 55 percent of participants were in favor of a ban on the manufacture, possession and sale of semiautomatic guns. A majority of respondents also supported other measures, including raising the legal age at which people can purchase certain firearms, and enacting a 30-day waiting period for gun sales. But the jumps in demand for gun control that occur after mass shootings also tend to revert to the partisan mean as time passes. Gallup poll data shows that the percentage of participants who supported stricter gun laws receded to 57 percent in October from 66 percent in June, which was just weeks after mass shootings in Uvalde, Texas, and Buffalo. A PDK poll conducted after the shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde found that 72 percent of Republicans supported arming teachers, in contrast with 24 percent of Democrats. Opponents of gun control, including most Republican members of Congress, argue that proposals to limit access to firearms infringe on the right of citizens to bear arms enshrined in the Second Amendment to the Constitution. And they contend that mass shootings are not the result of easily accessible guns, but of criminals and mentally ill people bent on waging violence. ? Annie Karni Polling suggests that Americans broadly support gun control measures, yet legislation is often stymied in Washington, and Republicans rarely seem to pay a political price for their opposition. The calculation behind Republicans¡¯ steadfast stonewalling of any new gun regulations ? even in the face of the kind unthinkable massacres like in Uvalde, Texas ? is a fairly simple one for Senator Kevin Cramer of North Dakota. Asked what the reaction would be from voters back home if he were to support any significant form of gun control, the first-term Republican had a straightforward answer: ¡°Most would probably throw me out of office,¡± he said. His response helps explain why Republicans have resisted proposals such as the one for universal background checks for gun buyers, despite remarkably broad support from the public for such plans ? support that can reach up to 90 percent nationwide in some cases. Republicans like Mr. Cramer understand that they would receive little political reward for joining the push for laws to limit access to guns, including assault-style weapons. But they know for certain that they would be pounded ? and most likely left facing a primary opponent who could cost them their job ? for voting for gun safety laws or even voicing support for them. Most Republicans in the Senate represent deeply conservative states where gun ownership is treated as a sacred privilege enshrined in the Constitution, a privilege not to be infringed upon no matter how much blood is spilled in classrooms and school hallways around the country. Though the National Rifle Association has recently been diminished by scandal and financial turmoil, Democrats say that the organization still has a strong hold on Republicans through its financial contributions and support, hardening the party¡¯s resistance to any new gun laws. ? Carl Hulse, ¡°Why Republicans Won¡¯t Budge on Guns.¡± Yet while the power of the gun lobby, the outsize influence of rural states in the Senate and single-voter issues offer some explanation, there is another possibility: voters. When voters in four Democratic-leaning states got the opportunity to enact expanded gun or ammunition background checks into law, the overwhelming support suggested by national surveys was nowhere to be found. For Democrats, the story is both unsettling and familiar. Progressives have long been emboldened by national survey results that show overwhelming support for their policy priorities, only to find they don¡¯t necessarily translate to Washington legislation and to popularity on Election Day or beyond. President Biden¡¯s major policy initiatives are popular, for example, yet voters say he has not accomplished much and his approval ratings have sunk into the low 40s.The apparent progressive political majority in the polls might just be illusory. Public support for new gun restrictions tends to rise in the wake of mass shootings. There is already evidence that public support for stricter gun laws has surged again in the aftermath of the killings in Buffalo and Uvalde, Texas. While the public¡¯s support for new restrictions tends to subside thereafter, these shootings or another could still produce a lasting shift in public opinion. But the poor results for background checks suggest that public opinion may not be the unequivocal ally of gun control that the polling makes it seem. ? Nate Cohn, ¡°Voters Say They Want Gun Control.

https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/02/us/gun-control-congress.html?searchResultPosition=8,2022-12-02,"As Shootings Continue, Prospects for Gun Control Action in Congress Remain Dim","With Republicans taking control of the House in January, the chances that Congress will consider any added restrictions in next two years are also exceedingly slim. By Carl Hulse WASHINGTON ? Despite calls by President Biden and others for postelection action on gun control while Democrats still hold Congress, lawmakers engaged on the issue see little chance that there will be another serious gun debate this year in the aftermath of mass killings in Colorado and Virginia. With the lame-duck agenda already overflowing and Republicans resistant to reopening the issue after a surprise bipartisan success on gun safety last summer, proponents of tougher restrictions on assault weapons, universal background checks and other measures say the window for more legislation is likely closed. ¡°It is a very crowded calendar,¡± said Senator Chris Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut and one of the chief architects of the gun deal earlier this year. ¡°I would obviously support taking time to talk about gun violence, but we have a lot of competing priorities.¡± Congress still needs to come to terms on funding the government into next year, consider the annual Pentagon policy bill and try to overhaul the Electoral Count Act to address vulnerabilities exposed during the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the Capitol. A new gun debate could roil the House and Senate at a critical time and have little chance of resulting in a new law, said Mr. Murphy and others, who conceded that backers of a ban on new assault-style weapons lack the 60 votes necessary to overcome a filibuster. ¡°The blunt, stark fact is that there simply aren¡¯t enough votes,¡± said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut. ¡°The votes aren¡¯t there.¡± The inability to take up gun legislation again this year means any realistic chance to pass new gun restrictions will have to wait at least two years. The new Republican majority in the House will adamantly oppose an assault weapons ban or other measure seen as infringing on gun rights. Given the new partisan dynamic, gun safety will revert to being mainly a political football as the two parties jockey for advantage heading into 2024. The White House tacitly acknowledged as much this week after Mr. Biden said on Thanksgiving that he intended to renew his push for a ban on assault weapons following mass shootings at an L.G.B.T.Q. club in Colorado Springs and a Walmart in Chesapeake, Va. Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, allowed that an assault weapons ban would be an ¡°uphill battle,¡± but said that Mr. Biden wouldn¡¯t drop the subject just because it could not advance in Congress. ¡°We understand that this is not easy, he gets that,¡± she said. ¡°But it doesn¡¯t mean that he¡¯s going to stop fighting for it or that he¡¯s going to stop talking about it.¡± She also noted that Mr. Biden had signed into law the most significant gun legislation in decades in June, following the shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Tex., that killed 19 children and two adults and a racially motivated shooting at a supermarket in Buffalo, N.Y., that claimed 10 lives. That measure, which was negotiated in the Senate, did not go as far as Democrats would have preferred. But it took new steps to try to halt the shooting epidemic by providing incentives for states to enact ¡°red flag¡± laws to deny guns to individuals perceived to be threats, and new mental health resources and funding for programs to reduce school violence. It also imposed enhanced background checks on gun buyers between the ages of 18 and 21 and barred people convicted of abuse against romantic partners from buying guns. Republican backers saw it as providing new tools to deter violence while steering clear of infringing on Second Amendment rights, a main reason for their opposition to an assault weapons ban. Senator John Cornyn of Texas, a chief Republican negotiator on the legislation, said Republicans were not interested in another struggle over gun rights so soon after what they saw as a significant legislative success. ¡°We put a lot into what I consider to be a very important bill post-Uvalde,¡± Mr. Cornyn said. ¡°It made the single largest investment in community-based mental health care, provided a lot of resources to schools to make them safer and enhanced the background check system for a vulnerable population between 18 to 21. We haven¡¯t even seen it be fully implemented, and won¡¯t for a while.¡± Mr. Cornyn said he agreed with Mr. Murphy that 60 votes for an assault weapons ban were out of reach at the moment. ¡°I understand some people think it¡¯s the gun, rather than the person that pulls the trigger,¡± he said. ¡°I think it is just a basic difference of opinion. I think law-abiding gun owners are not a threat to public safety and some on the left disagree with that.¡± Though any new gun law remains out of reach, Democrats could still bring up a measure and force a floor vote to, in Mr. Murphy¡¯s words, ¡°see where people stand.¡± Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the majority leader, on Tuesday would not rule out trying to force a vote on the issue in the coming weeks and said he wanted a ban to become law. ¡°Look, the bottom line is that I am the author of the assault weapons ban,¡± said Mr. Schumer about the expired legislation that he first proposed and saw enacted as a member of the House in 1994. ¡°I believe in it strongly. And we¡¯re continuing to work to see the best way we can try to get this done.¡± But with time running short in the final weeks of Congress, pushing a purely political vote risks infuriating Republicans when majority Democrats still need some cooperation across the aisle to finish up their work. Mr. Murphy noted that because they held on to the Senate majority in last month¡¯s midterms, Democrats will be able to revisit the issue in 2023, even if any vote would be little more than a symbolic move in the face of opposition from the Republican-led House. ¡°We always have the ability to take this vote next year to put people on record,¡± he said.

By Glenn Thrush WASHINGTON ? A federal judge in Kansas City on Tuesday struck down a Missouri law that restricted local and state law enforcement agencies in carrying out federal gun laws, ruling that the statute violated the Constitution and posed a grave threat to public safety. Judge Brian C. Wimes of the Western District of Missouri ruled that?the Second Amendment Protection Act, passed in 2021 by the Republican-controlled state legislature, represented a blatant attempt to illegally usurp the federal government¡¯s constitutional right to enforce federal laws without state interference. In his 24-page decision, Judge Wimes wrote that Missouri is now ¡°prohibited from any and all implementation and enforcement¡± of the law, which had allowed gun owners to seek damages of up to $50,000 from local police and sheriff¡¯s departments that enforced federal gun laws deemed to conflict with Second Amendment rights. The law ? passed as part of a right-wing backlash to President Biden¡¯s pledge to press for new gun control legislation ? was popular with the state¡¯s Republican politicians but faced skepticism from conservative law enforcement officials who said it hampered their capacity to fight surging gun violence in the state. ¡°We are gratified by the court¡¯s decision,¡±?Attorney General Merrick B. Garland said in a statement, adding that it would ¡°allow federal, state and local law enforcement in Missouri to work together to keep their communities safe from gun violence.¡± Judge Wimes, an Obama appointee, expressed alarm in his ruling that some local and state departments had withdrawn from joint federal task forces in the wake of the law and had refused to use weapons databases administered by the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. In an affidavit filed in a state case in August 2021, the special agent in charge of the Kansas City field division of the A.T.F. reported that nearly a quarter of state and local enforcement officials who worked directly with the agency ? 12 of 53 officers ? had withdrawn from joint collaborations. In addition, state and local agencies had begun to restrict federal access to investigative resources they had historically shared, including the Missouri Information Analysis Center, a state crime database, and the Kansas City Police Department¡¯s records system, the agent said. Judge Wimes directed law enforcement officials in the state to ¡°lawfully participate in joint federal task forces¡± and share information with the federal government without fear of financial penalties. Missouri¡¯s Republican attorney general, Andrew Bailey, vowed ¡°to defend this statute to the highest court.¡± He said the state anticipated ¡°a better result¡± from federal appellate courts. ¡°The Second Amendment is what makes the rest of the amendments possible,¡± Mr. Bailey said. The Justice Department sued Missouri in February 2022, arguing that the state¡¯s law, rammed through over the objections of Democrats, violated the supremacy clause of the Constitution, which forbids states to override federal statutes. The bill¡¯s supporters argued that the new law was constitutional and did not prohibit federal agents from operating in Missouri. They have contended that the measure only blocked state and local law enforcement officials from working on cases without explicit proof that their actions would not contribute to the confiscation of guns from law-abiding citizens. But even supporters of the law have suggested that it might have gone too far. Shortly after signing the measure, Gov. Mike Parson of Missouri, a Republican and a former sheriff, floated the idea that the legislature should revisit it to address the objections of law enforcement officials. That did not happen. And two of the state politicians most closely associated with the bill were catapulted to higher federal office after highlighting their support for it. Eric Burlison, the state senator who sponsored the law, was elected to a House seat last year. Eric Schmitt, the state¡¯s former attorney general ? who defended the law ? was elected to the Senate.

By Annie Karni WASHINGTON ? The back-to-back mass shootings in California have once again underscored a political reality on Capitol Hill: Even after a pair of massacres that have shaken the country, Congress is unlikely to muster a bipartisan consensus to enact any additional gun control measures in response. At the Capitol this week, as leading Democrats have joined President Biden¡¯s call to impose new limits on access to firearms, Republicans virtually silent. The divergent reactions reflect the gulf between the two parties on the issue, even after they came together last year to push through the first major gun control legislation in decades. Negotiators regarded that modest measure, which was aimed at keeping firearms out of the hands of dangerous people, as the furthest they could go in forging a bipartisan compromise on guns. The chances of enacting more aggressive steps, like reinstating a ban on assault weapons, now appear all but nonexistent, with Republicans not only opposed to new limits but also putting forth new proposals to protect the free flow of guns. ¡°It¡¯s clear that the prevalence of guns in our country has made tragedies like this one too frequent,¡± Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the majority leader, said on Monday, reacting to the shooting over the weekend in Monterey Park, Calif., where 11 people were killed in what police called the deadliest mass shooting in Los Angeles County¡¯s history. ¡°While the Senate passed bipartisan gun safety legislation last year, and that was a very welcome move, more should be done.¡± Just hours after Mr. Schumer spoke on the Senate floor, a gunman killed seven people in two locations in Half Moon Bay, Calif. Mr. Biden told reporters on Tuesday that he was talking to Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, as well as Democratic lawmakers from the state, about a federal response. ¡°We¡¯re working out a number of things that we can and are going to be doing,¡± he said. Mr. Biden cited legislation introduced by Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, to reimpose the ban on assault weapons that expired nearly two decades ago. ¡°I am asking you all to send that to my desk as quickly as you can,¡± Mr. Biden said. ¡°No other nation fetishizes violence and guns like we do,¡± Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, said on Twitter. ¡°No other nation cares so little about who owns the machinery of mass slaughter.¡± Republicans, in contrast, said almost nothing in response to the most recent mass shootings. Even the rote messages delivering ¡°thoughts and prayers¡± for those affected by the shootings, often mocked by Democrats as an inadequate response to gun violence, were not on display. Senator Mitch McConnell, the minority leader and one of the 15 Senate Republicans who voted in favor of the gun safety legislation last year, made no public statement about the mass shootings. And in a sign of how low the expectations are that Congress would act to address the most recent violence, he was not even asked about them at his weekly news conference. Democrats have conceded that they do not have the 60 votes necessary to overcome a Republican filibuster and pass a new assault-style weapons ban. Even if they did, there is little chance that Speaker Kevin McCarthy would bring up such a measure for a vote in the House, where Republicans adamantly oppose an assault weapons ban or any measure seen as infringing on gun rights. On Tuesday night, Mr. McCarthy told reporters that California, his home state, already had some of the strictest gun laws in the nation. And he said he would not commit to taking up any new gun laws until he had more information about both shootings, which he described as atypical because of the older age of the gunmen. Last year, when Democrats still controlled both chambers in Congress, Mr. McCarthy, who was then the minority leader, whipped his members to vote against the bipartisan legislation that went on to become law in June, which enhanced background checks for prospective gun buyers ages 18 to 21. It also provided incentives for states to pass ¡°red flag¡± laws that allow guns to be temporarily confiscated from people whom a judge deems too dangerous to possess them. The measure also ensured for the first time that serious dating partners would be included in a federal law that bars domestic abusers from purchasing firearms, a longtime priority that has eluded gun safety advocates for years. In the new Congress, Republicans are not simply pushing back on additional Democratic gun safety efforts; they are proposing legislation that seeks to protect those who sell, own and make firearms. Representative Andy Biggs, Republican of Arizona, in the opening days of the new Congress, introduced the ¡°No SmartPay for Anti-2A Companies Act,¡± legislation that seeks to punish payment processors that list gun retailers in a separate payment category, which the bill¡¯s proponents say could lead to the creation of a national registry of gun owners. Representative Claudia Tenney, Republican of New York, introduced a resolution that would declare New York State¡¯s new law placing strict limits on guns outside the home, signed by Gov. Kathy Hochul last year, to be unconstitutional. And Representative Jack Bergman, Republican of Michigan, introduced legislation that would prohibit the federal government from entering into contracts with any entities that discriminate against firearm or ammunition companies or trade associations. In reaction to the weekend shooting that targeted a thriving Asian American suburb in California, some Republicans noted that strict gun laws in blue states like California do little to stop the violence. The guns used in those shootings, however, are often imported from states with looser gun restrictions. Representative Michael McCaul, Republican of Texas, told CNN he would not support any gun safety measure as a response to the epidemic of mass shootings in the country. Instead, Mr. McCaul said the way to combat gun violence was to collect public information online about potentially dangerous or unstable individuals, in order to stop threats before they happen. ¡°The way I look at it is, we need the intelligence, we need information sharing, we need to connect the dots,¡± he said, adding that many of the shooters who ultimately carry out massacres ¡°had warning signs along the way, we just didn¡¯t respond or pick it up.¡± In passing the bipartisan gun bill last year, the Senate upended nearly three decades of congressional paralysis on toughening the nation¡¯s gun laws. Even then, the legislation was not seen as a harbinger of a new era of bipartisan compromise on an intractable issue, but rather a brief moment of bipartisanship that would be difficult to replicate. Most Republicans opposed the bill, and many of those who backed it were not up for re-election. Those who did were branded as ¡°RINOs,¡± or Republicans in name only, by former President Donald J. Trump, who is running for re-election, and by some of the more extreme members of the House Republican Conference, which now holds the majority. Peter Baker and Catie Edmondson contributed reporting.

Jared Polis signed three bills into law on Friday that tighten restrictions on gun purchases and possession, as well as a fourth that makes it easier for victims of gun violence to sue firearm companies. The new laws will raise the age to buy any firearm to 21 from 18, and make it illegal to sell any gun to someone younger than 21; mandate a three-day waiting period between buying and receiving a gun; and expand the state¡¯s red flag law. Doctors, mental health professionals and teachers will now be allowed to petition judges to temporarily remove people¡¯s firearms, if they pose a threat to themselves or others. Before, only law enforcement officers and family members were able to file such requests. The fourth law makes it easier to sue gun manufacturers by eliminating the requirement that plaintiffs automatically pay the legal fees of gun-industry defendants when cases are dismissed. The law also will allow manufacturers to be sued under the Colorado Consumer Protection Act, which applies to all other businesses in the state. A fifth bill, which would have banned semiautomatic firearms, failed to make it out of the House Judiciary Committee. Mr. Polis signed the bills five months after an assailant killed five people and injured more than a dozen others in an L.G.B.T.Q. nightclub in Colorado Springs. The shooting took place last November, less than two weeks after Mr. Polis, a Democrat, won re-election to a second term. While states with Republican-led legislatures have been loosening restrictions on guns, Colorado ? where Democrats control both chambers of the legislature and the governor¡¯s office ? is one of a few states bucking that trend. Maryland, which just finished its legislative session and is also controlled by Democrats, is another. Colorado has been home to several high-profile mass shootings and has the 18th highest gun-death rate in the country. The state also has one of the highest gun suicide rates in the country, according to the most recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ¡°There are shootings everyday in Colorado that don¡¯t make the news; the majority of that is suicides,¡± said Lisa Geller, state affairs director at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions.  The law that granted the extra protections for gun and ammunition manufacturers and sellers against lawsuits from victims was passed in 2000, the year after the mass shooting at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., outside Denver. Mass killings at a movie theater in Aurora in 2012, at a supermarket in Boulder in 2021 and the recent attack in Colorado Springs have put the state in the spotlight for the country¡¯s gun carnage. The expansion of the red flag law is effective immediately. The rest of the laws could be put into effect by later this year, though they are already being challenged. Rocky Mountain Gun Owners, a gun-rights advocacy group in Colorado, has filed lawsuits over the three-day waiting period and minimum age requirement. The group said that people needing to defend themselves might not be able to get a gun in time to do so. Another bill that would ban the production and sale of ghost guns is still in front of legislators and is likely to pass during this term, which ends next week.

By Shaila Dewan Less than a month after 19 children and two teachers died in the elementary school shooting last year in Uvalde, Texas, the U.S. Senate passed the most significant gun control bill since the long-expired federal ban on assault weapons. The very same day, June 23, the Supreme Court upended gun policy in jurisdictions with some of the country¡¯s strictest laws, like New York, Washington, D.C. and California, saying for the first time that people have the right to carry guns outside their homes. In a country already raw with anger over gun policy, the new law from Congress and the sweeping decision by the Supreme Court only intensified the national fight over guns, spurring fresh legal challenges and legislative debates in courts and statehouses across the country. And in the year since Uvalde ? the deadliest school shooting since the 2012 massacre in Newtown, Conn. ? both sides of the issue have made gains and endured setbacks as they seek to define the role of guns in American life. From Colorado to Michigan to New Jersey, proponents of gun regulation have passed laws intended to limit access to firearms or blunt the effects of the Supreme Court case, New York State Rifle & Pistol Association Inc. v. Bruen. Opponents have moved swiftly to contest many such restrictions, using Bruen as the basis for one court challenge after another. And in states that were already gun friendly, gun rights groups have worked to further expand access to firearms. In April, Florida became the largest state besides Texas to do away with permit requirements, joining the broad swath of the country where it has become easier than ever to carry a gun. Even in the face of such striking changes, gun control supporters say their side is gaining ground. They point to a succession of legislative wins and to polls showing increasing public support for some degree of regulation. A poll released on Wednesday by NPR, PBS and Marist College found that 60 percent of Americans, including 4 in 10 who own guns, think it is more important to control gun violence than to protect gun rights. In the past week, Minnesota and Michigan became the 20th and 21st states to enact red flag laws designed to keep firearms out of the hands of people who are at risk of harming themselves or others. In New York last August, the state established gun-free zones in sensitive areas like Times Square. And in New Jersey in December, the governor signed into law a long list of places where guns were not permitted. The court challenges to some of those laws have been swift. In New York, a federal judge blocked parts of the law, but it has remained in effect while the state appeals. And just last week, a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction blocking many provisions of the New Jersey law. The judge said the state could not forbid guns in many of the settings set forth in the new law, including bars, doctors¡¯ offices and zoos, though private business owners could chose to do so. This week, New Jersey¡¯s attorney general asked a federal appeals court to put the lower court¡¯s injunction on hold while the state appealed the ruling. Dudley Brown, the president of the National Association for Gun Rights, which opposes any restrictions on gun ownership, said the Bruen decision was a bulwark against regulation and would help his organization win a host of lawsuits against gun restrictions. But he said that even with the Bruen ruling, a monumental victory in the Supreme Court, the fight would be playing out for years in state legislatures and lower courts that now have to interpret the decision. ¡°It often feels like one step forward, two steps back,¡± he said. Public opinion has long favored limiting access to guns, with the share of Americans saying that ¡°laws covering the sale of firearms should be made more strict¡± rarely dipping below half, according to Gallup. After the Uvalde shooting, the share rose to two-thirds of Americans. And gun control advocates have learned from their defeats, organizing and building political infrastructure. ¡°I worked in Congress for many years. I was never lobbied by a representative of a gun safety organization,¡± said Peter Ambler, referring to groups like the one he now directs, the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, that support limiting access to firearms. Now, Mr. Ambler said, such organizations have public opinion on their side and clout on Capitol Hill. Mass shootings have brought days of fiery protests even to statehouses where gun rights have long been sacrosanct, like Austin, Texas, where the families of Uvalde victims waited long hours to testify, and Nashville, where thousands of people clamored for an assault weapons ban, a red flag law and other gun control measures after three adults and three children were fatally shot by an assailant at the Covenant School in March. Gun regulation advocates say that red flag laws could prevent shootings like the one in Nashville, in which the suspect identified by the police had been in treatment for an emotional disorder and had recently purchased seven guns. But the legislature took no action, other than expelling two Democratic lawmakers who took the protest to the chamber floor. Now Gov. Bill Lee, a Republican, is saying that he will call lawmakers to a special session in August to address public safety. ¡°There is broad agreement that action is needed,¡± the governor said in a statement. Even when such modest steps do not yield results, gun regulation advocates see glimmers of progress, as when Republicans on a Texas legislative committee voted to approve a bill to raise the minimum age to buy assault weapons, only to have it blocked from reaching the floor. ¡°We¡¯ve seen these fissures emerge among elected Republicans,¡± Mr. Ambler said. Advocates contrast the political calculus today to another moment when a terrible shooting was met with demands for action: the Sandy Hook school shooting in Newtown. A federal bill to expand background checks was defeated, with some Congressional Democrats breaking ranks to vote no. Last summer, it was the other way around: 15 Republican senators broke with their party to vote for the federal gun bill, called the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. Some gun control advocates say that efforts to make it easier to carry guns can coexist with measures that keep guns out of the hands of those who intend to do harm. ¡°Laws that actually use a scalpel to really identify risk, and laws that can prevent that risk from turning into mayhem, is the most important thing to focus on,¡± said John Feinblatt, the president of Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun control group founded by Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire media magnate and former New York City mayor. ¡°This can¡¯t be a referendum on gun ownership. This is a referendum on safety.""

By Jill Cowan LOS ANGELES ? California has some of the most stringent gun laws in the country, including various bans on assault-style weapons and other measures meant to keep firearms out of the hands of people who might use them to harm themselves or others. Last year, in response to the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, state lawmakers ? urged by Gov. Gavin Newsom, an outspoken critic of gun policies in Republican-led states and at the federal level ? approved a barrage of new measures. Yet as the body count from mass shootings continues to pile up in the nation¡¯s most populous state, many Californians are left asking: Why? And how? Gun policy experts said that a national culture that accepts routine violence, combined with an inability to enforce gun controls in one state that is surrounded by others where rules are more lax, means that California will continue to grapple with public mass violence. ¡°We are part of a culture that celebrates violence as a means of problem-solving in a country that has made firearms more available than any industrialized country ever,¡± said Dr. Garen J. Wintemute, an emergency room doctor who directs the Violence Prevention Research Program at the University of California, Davis, Medical Center. ¡°We have no right to be surprised when these things happen.¡± The authorities this week said that they were still investigating where the gunman in the Monterey Park shooting, in which 11 people were killed and several others wounded, obtained weapons, and whether those weapons are banned in California. Investigators were also trying to discern whether California laws would have prevented the suspect from legally possessing guns after a 1994 arrest in which he was accused of the unlawful possession of a firearm. Dr. Wintemute said that the complexity of California¡¯s gun control laws and when they went into effect make determining the legality of any given person¡¯s possession of weapons difficult to resolve. Beyond California¡¯s borders, moves by conservative state lawmakers and the Supreme Court to roll back restrictions on gun ownership seem to be part of a broad effort to take gun policy to its ¡°logical extreme,¡± removing essentially all controls, Dr. Wintemute said. The responsibility to prevent mass shootings, he said, rests with ordinary Californians, who ? unlike Americans in many other states ? can report threats by co-workers, family members or partners under the state¡¯s red flag law, which went into effect in 2016 and prevents certain people from obtaining firearms. ¡°We¡¯re angry, we¡¯re polarized, we¡¯re exhausted,¡± Dr. Wintemute said. ¡°All of us have to make a choice to step up and be a part of the solution. The only alternative is this will continue.¡± Jill Cowan is a Los Angeles-based reporter for the National desk covering California. More about Jill Cowan Advertisement",NYT
https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/20/us/illinois-gun-ban-second-amendment.html?searchResultPosition=14,2023-01-20,Illinois Passed a Sweeping Ban on High-Powered Guns. Now Come the Lawsuits.,"Democrats say the new law, the most extensive firearm ban in the Midwest, will save lives, but gun rights supporters claim it is unconstitutional. By Mitch Smith CHICAGO ? When Illinois legislators passed a far-reaching ban last week on selling certain high-powered guns and high-capacity magazines, the Democrats who run the state celebrated it as a lifesaving law that would help prevent mass violence. But on Friday, in the law¡¯s first judicial test, a state judge in Effingham County temporarily blocked it from being enforced against hundreds of people and several gun dealers who sued. That ruling, a preliminary step and one of several legal tests the law is likely to face, came amid broad uncertainty about whether sweeping gun controls like those in Illinois can withstand judicial scrutiny following a Supreme Court decision in a New York case last year. Within days of Gov. J.B. Pritzker signing the Illinois legislation, at least three lawsuits were filed challenging it in state and federal courts. Though the case in Effingham County, a conservative area east of St. Louis, focused on claims that the law violated the Illinois Constitution, two other lawsuits, in Federal District Court in Southern Illinois and in state court in rural Crawford County, included Second Amendment arguments that invoked the Supreme Court¡¯s New York ruling. The judge in Effingham County, Joshua Morrison, also mentioned the New York case in his ruling on Friday granting a temporary restraining order. ¡°The big picture is just a lot of uncertainty and a lot of unpredictability until there is agreement on some kind of way to apply¡± the ruling from last year¡¯s Supreme Court case, said Andrew Willinger, the executive director of the Center for Firearms Law at Duke University. In that case, New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen, the court found that Americans have a broad right to arm themselves in public and struck down a New York law that placed strict limits on carrying guns outside the home. The decision, in which the court¡¯s six conservative justices were in the majority and its three liberal justices dissented, has led to a wave of litigation and legislation nationwide. Judges and lawmakers have disagreed on how to apply the new precedent, and activists on all sides of the gun debate have strained to find where the new lines are. Mr. Pritzker said the ruling on Friday was disappointing but ¡°not surprising,¡± and expressed confidence that the law would ultimately be upheld. The office of Attorney General Kwame Raoul said it would appeal. Even before its new weapon ban, Illinois had the most extensive gun restrictions in the Midwest, including a requirement that residents be licensed by the State Police to own firearms. But legislators were spurred to go further after a gunman killed seven people and wounded dozens of others with a high-powered rifle at a Fourth of July parade last year in Highland Park, a Chicago suburb that had been at the center of a court fight over its municipal ban on certain weapons. The new state law, which took immediate effect, made Illinois one of nine states with some form of what advocates call an assault weapon ban, according to the Giffords Law Center, which supports gun restrictions. Under the new Illinois rules, a long list of specific types of semiautomatic weapons, including AR-15-style rifles, are no longer allowed to be sold to residents, and people who currently own them were given a deadline to register them with law enforcement. Though supporters of the law acknowledged the limits of legislating weapon sales on a state-by-state basis ? Illinois borders several states with loose gun laws, contributing to its long-running struggles with violence ? they said the new legislation would still have an impact. Congressional Democrats have attempted to restore a national ban on assault weapons, but have been blocked by Republicans. ¡°It does matter to have these laws in place, to have restrictions in place,¡± said Ari Freilich, the state policy director at Giffords, who said the Illinois law would put gun sellers on notice and help lessen the risk of high-casualty mass shootings. Gun rights supporters, however, were incensed, calling the law an unconstitutional overreach that exposed responsible gun owners to criminal charges and banned the sale of common firearms. ¡°The boot heel of government has been placed squarely on the neck of freedom-loving Illinois citizens,¡± Richard Pearson, the executive director of the Illinois State Rifle Association, said in a statement. His organization is a plaintiff in the federal lawsuit, which has been assigned to a judge who was appointed by President Donald J. Trump. Though Democrats control state government in Illinois, thanks largely to their dominance around Chicago, conservative Republicans run local governments throughout much of the state. Many Illinois sheriffs said they would not prioritize enforcing the law¡¯s gun registration rules and did not plan to arrest people solely for violating that requirement. Sheila Simon, a law professor at Southern Illinois University who once served as the state¡¯s Democratic lieutenant governor, said those statements underscored the geographic and political divides within Illinois.  ¡°A county cannot opt out of state laws,¡± Ms. Simon said. ¡°So when sheriffs say they¡¯re not going to enforce a state law, I hope that what they mean by that is that they¡¯re going to be part of a lawsuit to challenge the law.¡± Farrah Anderson contributed reporting.

By Mike Baker and Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs Washington State approved a package of gun control measures on Tuesday that includes a ban on the sale of military-style semiautomatic weapons, making it the ninth state to join efforts to prevent the distribution of AR-15s and other powerful rifles often used in mass shootings. The new laws put Washington in the ranks of states with the strongest gun control measures in the nation. They include a 10-day waiting period on gun purchases, gun safety training requirements and a provision allowing the state attorney general and consumers to sue gun manufacturers or dealers under public nuisance laws if they negligently allow their guns to fall into the hands of minors or ¡°dangerous individuals.¡± Gun rights proponents swiftly filed a lawsuit to challenge the semiautomatic rifle ban, saying it infringed on Second Amendment rights. Washington is among a series of states, largely led by Democrats, that have advanced gun legislation this year as the nation continues to grapple with repeated mass shootings. Republicans have moved in the opposite direction, with lawmakers in several states introducing legislation to expand the ability to carry concealed weapons without a permit and eliminate such things as gun-free zones, background checks and red-flag laws, which allow the removal of guns from people deemed to be at high risk of violence or self-harm. About half of all states now allow people to carry a handgun without a permit, up from 16 states in 2020. AR-15-style rifles have been a particular point of concern among gun control proponents as they have often been the weapon of choice in mass shootings. The high-capacity firearms can fire rounds at a greater velocity than a handgun, resulting in more severe injuries. In signing the new laws, Gov. Jay Inslee said there was no legitimate purpose for such weapons. ¡°These weapons of war, assault weapons, have no reason other than mass murder,¡± Mr. Inslee said. ¡°Their only purpose is to kill humans as rapidly as possible in large numbers.¡± In 1994, as a congressman representing rural areas in Washington, Mr. Inslee voted for a federal assault weapons ban ? a vote he said contributed to his re-election loss later that year. That ban passed but expired in 2004 and has never been renewed. Last summer, in the months after a young gunman used an AR-15-style rifle to fatally shoot 19 children and two teachers at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill that would have reinstated the federal ban, but it stalled in the Senate. The new laws in Washington State follow similar bans in other liberal-leaning states and Washington, D.C. Some states, such as California, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Massachusetts, have had such a prohibition on the books for decades, and Maryland has banned the weapons since 2013. But as the number of high-profile mass shootings continues to escalate, several more states have enacted bans. Illinois adopted a ban in January, and Delaware passed a similar law last year. Hawaii has banned so-called assault pistols with certain features since 1992 but does not ban military-style rifles. Colorado lawmakers introduced a similar ban last month, but the House bill failed to make it out of committee after three Democrats voted with Republicans to kill it, according to local media reports. All of the bans currently in place allow people to keep weapons previously purchased, but states vary on how those so-called legacy weapons are regulated, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. The new laws enacted in Washington join a series of other gun control measures that have been adopted in the state in recent years. In 2018, voters approved an initiative that raised the age for purchasing military-style rifles to 21 and created an enhanced background check system for those guns that included a 10-day waiting period. The new legislation now requires a 10-day waiting period for purchasing any kind of gun. While several states require waiting periods, only California and Hawaii require a full 10 days. Washington is one of nine states that require gun buyers to provide proof of training. Legislation allowing lawsuits against private parties for negligent sales has now been passed in five states. Representative Liz Berry, a Democratic lawmaker in Washington who sponsored one of the new bills, said she ran for office three years ago because she was angry over the number of people affected by gun violence. She said the new waiting period was critical to prevent guns from being used by people in crisis; training requirements, she said, can help people learn about safe weapons handling and how to keep guns away from children. Ms. Berry noted that students in Washington had engaged in recent protests to persuade lawmakers to take action to end gun violence. ¡°We see you.

He will also meet with the British prime minister while in California. By Katie Rogers WASHINGTON ? President Biden plans to travel next week to Monterey Park, Calif., where a gunman killed 11 people at a dance studio in January, to call for tougher gun control measures amid a spate of mass shootings throughout the United States. Mr. Biden will visit the Southern California city on Tuesday, according to a White House official who was not authorized to speak publicly about his plans. The trip is part of a West Coast swing that will begin on Monday in San Diego, where he will meet with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak of Britain and Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of Australia, and end in Nevada. This week, the Gun Violence Archive, a nonprofit research group, said the United States had surpassed 100 mass shootings, defined as one in which at least four people were killed or injured, since the beginning of the year. The official did not say if Mr. Biden planned to visit the site of the shooting or meet with Brandon Tsay, the young man who stopped Huu Can Tran, 72, from entering his family¡¯s dance studio about 20 minutes after Mr. Tran killed 11 people at a nearby ballroom in January. Mr. Tsay was a guest at Mr. Biden¡¯s State of the Union address last month, in which the president called for a ban on assault weapons. Mr. Biden has repeatedly called for such a ban in recent public speeches, highlighting not only the issue but also the limits of his power to do anything about it. Even with majorities in both houses of Congress during Mr. Biden¡¯s first two years in office, Democrats were unable to pass a ban, and any effort now would be all but certain to die in the Republican-controlled House. That has left Mr. Biden with few options but the bully pulpit. ¡°We¡¯re going to ban assault weapons again come hell or high water,¡± Mr. Biden told Democrats last week in Baltimore. As a senator, Mr. Biden negotiated a 10-year assault weapons ban as part of a broader crime bill in 1994, which led to a temporary drop in gun crime and shootings of police officers, according to a study by the Justice Department. The ban blocked the sale of 19 weapons that had features used by the United States military, including semiautomatic rifles and certain types of shotguns and handguns, and it was opposed by Republicans and the National Rifle Association. Last summer, Congress passed a bipartisan bill that bolstered background checks for potential gun buyers under the age of 21 and pumped federal money into states to implement so-called red flag laws that allow officials to temporarily confiscate guns from people found in court to be too dangerous to own them. Last month, the Justice Department announced a $200 million program to fund state crisis intervention programs in an effort to reduce gun violence. The bill was considered a compromise, and Democrats said it fell far short of the sort of assault weapons ban Mr. Biden has proposed. Stephanie Lai contributed reporting.

Parked Cars.,"The growing number of firearms kept in vehicles has become a new point of contention in the debates over regulating gun safety. In 2020, over half of all gun thefts were from cars, according to the gun control group Everytown for Gun Safety, which analyzed FBI data. Credit...Eric Ryan Anderson for The New York Times Supported by By Richard Fausset NASHVILLE ? On a Sunday in January 2022, a Glock 9mm pistol, serial number AFDN559, disappeared from a Dodge Charger parked near a Midtown Nashville bank after someone smashed in the rear driver¡¯s side window. Ten months later, Nashville police officers arrested three teenagers suspected in a series of shootings, and discovered a cache of weapons in a nearby apartment. Among them was AFDN559. Forensic analysts would later tie the Glock to three shootings, including an attack in August that wounded four youths and another that wounded a 17-year-old girl in September. In a country awash with guns, with more firearms than people, the parked car, or in many cases the parked pickup truck, has become a new flashpoint?in the debates over how and whether to regulate gun safety. There is little question about the scope of the problem. A report issued in May by the gun-control group Everytown for Gun Safety analyzed FBI crime data in 271 American cities, large and small, from 2020 and found that guns stolen from vehicles have become the nation¡¯s largest source of stolen firearms ? with an estimated 40,000 guns stolen from cars in those cities alone. In some cities, organized groups of young people have swept through neighborhoods and areas around sports arenas, looking for weapons left under car seats or in unlocked center consoles or glove compartments. Their work is occasionally made easier by motorists who advertise their right to bear arms with car window stickers promoting favored gun brands, or that declare ¡°molon labe¡± ? a defiant message from ancient Sparta, which roughly translates as ¡°come and take them.¡± Increasingly, thieves are doing just that. The Everytown researchers found that a decade ago, less than a quarter of all gun thefts were from cars; in 2020, over half of them were. The researchers say more study is needed to understand the shift, which has occurred as more states have adopted permitless carry laws and messages in gun-industry marketing have encouraged Americans to take their weapons with them for personal protection. And as the problem has grown, public health officials and lawmakers, including some in Tennessee, have proposed a rather prosaic solution: encouraging or mandating that gun-toting drivers store their weapons in their vehicles inside of sturdy, lockable gun boxes. Gun control advocates are hoping that the adoption of the boxes in cars will come to be seen as a solution that both sides of the gun debate can accept, much as both sides encourage the use of gun safes and trigger locks in the home. ¡°I do think that safe storage is where we find a lot of common ground,¡± said Christian Heyne, vice president of policy and programs at Brady, the gun-violence prevention organization. But some experts say widespread adoption of the boxes may require a dramatic cultural change akin to the revolution in seatbelt use. And it may prove to be even more polarizing than seatbelts ever were. The National Rifle Association and other gun-rights advocates believe car lockbox mandates to be an onerous burden ? a reflection of how the avalanche of guns is creating new sources of conflict. Many lockboxes are relatively cheap. Simple versions that can attach to the underside of a car seat with a cable can be found for about $40, and some cities have even begun developing programs to give them away. In Houston, where more than 4,400 guns were stolen from cars last year, the police have given away roughly 700 such boxes this year, according to Houston Police Sgt. Tracy Hicks, and have plans to give away 6,300 more. Some skeptics doubt even widespread use of the boxes would make much of a dent in gun violence in a nation with more than 400 million firearms in circulation. ¡°It¡¯s like peeing in the Gulf of Mexico,¡± said Peter Scharf, a criminologist at the Louisiana State University School of Medicine in New Orleans, which had one of the nation¡¯s highest homicide rates in 2022. In Nashville, the number of guns reported stolen from cars there increased nearly tenfold over the last decade, to a record 1,378 in 2022 from 152 in 2012, according to police data. The city¡¯s rate of gun thefts from cars was the 15th highest in the country in 2020, based on FBI figures. The situation was even worse in Memphis, Tennessee¡¯s second-largest city, which had the highest rate of gun thefts from cars in the nation that year, according to the Everytown analysis. It is difficult to know how many stolen guns are used in crimes, in part because only 15 states have laws requiring the reporting of lost or stolen guns. ¡°We don¡¯t ask enough where guns used in crime come from,¡± Mr. Heyne said. Tennessee¡¯s Republican-dominated state legislature is considering a pair of bills with bipartisan support that would explicitly outlaw leaving a firearm in a motor vehicle or boat unless it is ¡°locked within the trunk, utility or glove box, or a locked container securely affixed.¡± The only allowable punishment, under the bill, would be enrollment in a court-approved firearm safety course. It is a purposely mild approach engineered to help create buy-in, rather than another culture-war battle, said Representative Caleb Hemmer, a Nashville-area Democrat who sponsored the House bill. ¡°We¡¯re likening it to a speeding ticket,¡± Mr. Hemmer said. ¡°We know we¡¯re in a conservative state, and we¡¯re trying to convince people to be responsible gun owners.¡± Mr. Hemmer believes there is a relationship between the spike in the number of guns stolen from cars in Nashville and the loosening of state gun laws, including a 2021 permitless carry law. Mr. Hemmer¡¯s bill is supported by John C. Drake, the Nashville Police chief, who on Tuesday wrote a letter to legislative leaders in which he mentioned that the high-profile robbery and killing of a local country musician, Kyle Yorlets, in 2019 was carried out by youths using a pistol stolen from a vehicle. ¡°With gun ownership comes serious responsibility on several fronts, including securing guns, particularly in motor vehicles, so that they do not come into the hands of thieves/violent criminals,¡± Mr. Drake wrote. The Tennessee lockbox legislation is already generating controversy, an indication of how steadfastly gun-rights advocates oppose nearly any laws that might restrict gun owners. The legislation is opposed by the N.R.A. Amy Hunter, an N.R.A. spokeswoman, called Mr. Hemmer¡¯s bill ¡°feckless¡± in a statement and said it would discourage theft victims from reporting the stolen guns to the police. ¡°This law can only be enforced if someone¡¯s gun is stolen, the victim then reports the theft and admits the gun was unsecured ? at which point the theft victim is charged with a crime,¡± she said. In Chapel Hill, Tenn., a small town about 50 miles south of Nashville, David Henley, 51, the owner of the gun store Tennessee Armory and Outdoor Supply, had a similar view. It would be better, he said, to increase penalties for the thieves. ¡°If you¡¯re at your house and a package is sitting on your porch, and a criminal comes and steals it, it¡¯s the same thing,¡± he said. ¡°Who¡¯s the criminal?¡± Representative John Gillespie, a Memphis Republican who co-sponsored Mr. Hemmer¡¯s bill, was frustrated by such arguments. ¡°I¡¯m more than willing to increase the penalties for people stealing a gun,¡± he said. ¡°But are we really that burdened by asking someone to properly lock up their gun in a vehicle so it can¡¯t be stolen?¡± Laws mandating that guns in cars be locked away are already on the books in some states, including California, Oregon, New York and New Jersey. A number of similarly themed bills are under consideration in other states including Hawaii and Florida. A Virginia bill, introduced by a Democratic senator in that state¡¯s Democratic-controlled upper chamber, did not survive the 2023 legislative session, which ended in late February. Cities are also taking action. In January, the Atlanta City Council passed an ordinance seeking to create a lockbox giveaway program. In New Orleans, Tulane University¡¯s Violence Prevention Institute has begun giving away gun boxes with biometric thumbprint locks at a local hospital. ¡°The hard thing is, when you talk to people about why they carry guns in cars, it¡¯s about safety and protection. And when you talk about lockboxes, the rebuttal is, ¡®Well, I don¡¯t have quick access to my gun,¡¯¡± said Julia Fleckman, co-director of the Tulane institute. In St. Louis, police have recently begun actively enforcing a five-year-old law that mandates that guns be stored in locked containers. Nick Dunne, a spokesman for Mayor Tishaura O. Jones, noted that judges are giving people the opportunity to have their cases dismissed if they show the court that they have purchased a lockbox. Mr. Dunne said that of 192 citations written last year, roughly three-quarters of them were issued to people who did not live in St. Louis ??an indication of how the political and cultural differences between cities and rural and suburban areas help fuel the problem. Houston Police Sgt. Hicks says that part of his job involves trying to get the word out to people who come in town for big sporting events. Sgt. Hicks said that it is not just out of town visitors who are targeted by gun thieves, although he said that they know to look for clues that suggest a gun is more likely to be in a car. ¡°You¡¯ve got a Prius with a unicorn sticker or a big F250 with a Glock sticker,¡± he said, referring to the popular Ford pickup truck. ¡°Which one is more likely to get broken into?¡± An earlier version of this story misstated the party that controls the Virginia State Senate.

Cuts Session Short With No Action on Gun Control,"Republicans not only rebuffed the demands of protesters but also punted on a proposal from the state¡¯s conservative governor, who said he would now call them back for a special session. By Emily Cochrane NASHVILLE ? Hundreds of students, parents and teachers marched to the Tennessee State Capitol, day after day, demanding a ban on assault weapons and action on gun control. Their calls were echoed by musicians like Amy Grant and Sheryl Crow, who trekked to the legislature to personally lobby lawmakers after a mass shooting at a Nashville Christian school. Several faith leaders joined the effort, writing to Republican leaders to urge them to support a proposal that would help temporarily restrict access to guns for people found by a court to be a danger to themselves or others. But on Friday, just under a month after the attack at the school, Republicans instead cut short the year¡¯s legislative session and punted on any measure dealing explicitly with guns, capping a whirlwind three months of lawmaking that underscored the power of the far-right flank of the Republican Party in Tennessee and saw the brief expulsion of two Black Democratic lawmakers. ¡°It¡¯s frustrating and motivating,¡± said Jamie Starnes, 37, who spent Friday morning protesting in the Capitol with a group of mothers, many of whom had never demonstrated in person until their friends and their children were traumatized by the shooting at the Covenant School that killed three adults and three 9-year-olds. ¡°We¡¯re not going anywhere,¡± she added. Within two hours of the legislature¡¯s hasty departure, the state¡¯s Republican governor, Bill Lee, announced that he would summon lawmakers back for a special session to revisit the debate, with details expected in the coming weeks. Mr. Lee, whose wife lost a friend in the attack, had pushed the legislature to pass an order of protection law, which, in an effort to win conservative support, had become so limited in scope that some experts said it would not even qualify as the type of ¡°red flag law¡± scorned by gun rights supporters. ¡°There is broad agreement that dangerous, unstable individuals who intend to harm themselves or others should not have access to weapons,¡± Mr. Lee said in a statement. ¡°We also share a strong commitment to preserving Second Amendment rights, ensuring due process and addressing the heart of the problem with strengthened mental health resources.¡± But it was clear as the legislature departed on Friday that any measure that would limit access to guns, even one as narrow as the proposal championed by Mr. Lee, would face steep odds with the Republican supermajority. Republicans largely panned that proposal and argued that they were too far into the session to revamp the state budget and examine the ramifications of such a law. Instead, they highlighted passage of about $140 million to fund school resource police officers on public school campuses, another request from Mr. Lee. Speaker Cameron Sexton suggested that Republicans would look elsewhere, having discussed other proposals that would ¡°focus on the mental health aspect of this and just closing loopholes currently in the law.¡± ¡°Hopefully we¡¯ll get another opportunity,¡± he added, speaking at a news conference Friday evening. ¡°I also think it¡¯s important once again to have these conversations outside of the Capitol with the public and let them have input on exactly how we should move forward.¡± The calls for additional time and discussion, however, were a stark contrast in a session in which the assembly¡¯s supermajority also significantly undermined the autonomy of the state¡¯s largest Democratic-leaning cities and cut back the rights of L.G.B.T.Q. people, despite outcry from those communities. The legislature exerted further control over the cities by dissolving two civilian police oversight boards ? despite calls to invest in those organizations after the fatal beating of Tyre Nichols at the hands of Memphis police officers this year ? and by handing local control of the Nashville Airport Authority to the state. It also gave final approval to a bill that would prevent transgender people from changing their gender on state identification documents, despite the risk of losing federal funding. Republicans also passed a ban on policies requiring teachers to take antiracism training and a measure aimed at curbing the teaching of ¡°divisive concepts¡± on college campuses, which Democrats warned would have a chilling effect on discussions of racism and sexism. Several of those measures now await Mr. Lee¡¯s signature. The state now faces several lawsuits, the most recent coming on Thursday, when the American Civil Liberties Union and other organizations sued over a ban on transition care for transgender teenagers that is set to take effect in July. A $56.2 billion state budget cleared the legislature this week with near unanimity as Republicans scrambled to depart Nashville. It includes a temporary reprieve from the state¡¯s grocery tax and millions of dollars in tax cuts for businesses, and sets aside about $3 billion for road projects. Yet it is the debate over whether and how to restrict access to guns that is set to define the year¡¯s work, after thousands of students, teachers and Tennessee residents flooded the Capitol to urge lawmakers to act. Demonstrators marched with children¡¯s caskets, hundreds of students walked out of class, and thousands linked arms to form a three-mile human chain across the city. Some Republicans urged their colleagues in the state legislature to take some steps toward gun control, even as gun lobbies rallied against Mr. Lee¡¯s proposal and any glimmer of gun restriction. ¡°It should always be the right decision even if it costs you re-election,¡± Oscar Brock, a member of the Republican National Committee, said of the draft proposal. ¡°I wish they¡¯d taken the governor up on his offer.¡± ¡°I was a little disappointed,¡± he added. (Mr. Brock quickly added that his disappointment was not enough to shake his allegiance to the party.) The raw grief and rage over the legislature¡¯s inaction exploded when Republicans expelled two young Black Democrats and fell just short of ousting a third Democrat, a rare act of retribution after the three led a gun control protest on the House floor. The two men ? State Representatives Justin Jones of Nashville and Justin J. Pearson of Memphis ? were quickly reinstated by local officials and spent the final days of the session on their feet, taking turns sparring with Republicans in increasingly heated confrontations over gender and race. The expulsions inflamed already bitter tensions in the legislature and heightened national scrutiny of how the Republican supermajority has wielded its power and how it had let previous instances of?misconduct slide without severe punishment. A senior Republican, Scotty Campbell, abruptly resigned on Thursday, only hours after NewsChannel 5 disclosed details of a March 29 memo that found he had violated the chamber¡¯s ethics policy against sexual harassment. An outpouring of financial and political support galvanized Democrats in the state, who saw a glimmer of hope that their party could begin to wrest seats away from the Republican supermajority. In deeply gerrymandered Tennessee, where political power is determined largely in the Republican primaries, it remained unclear whether there would be any long-term backlash for conservative lawmakers. But Republicans appeared eager to decamp from Nashville, even temporarily, to escape the firestorm over the expulsions and their own internal turmoil. They churned through dozens of measures over a marathon week, repeatedly cutting off debate despite objections from Democrats. And they swatted away last-ditch procedural maneuvers that would have forced them to consider gun legislation, including a Democratic version of the red flag law and a prohibition on purchasing of semiautomatic rifles that carry more than 10 rounds. ¡°Why would you make the choice to leave and then come back when you could just do it right here, right now?¡± State Representative Karen Camper, the House Democratic leader, asked Republicans in a committee hearing on Friday. She added, ¡°People are yelling and screaming out to us to do something.¡± Conservative opposition to any?gun control?measure appeared too deeply entrenched, though Republicans continued to insist they were interested in solutions ¡°that prevent dangerous individuals from harming the public.¡± State Representative William Lamberth, a member of the Republican leadership, said that ¡°there¡¯s a lot of good stuff there, but as written, I still think it needs work.¡± Several gun researchers, however, balked at the conservative opposition, arguing that the measure had been watered down to the point where it fell far short of the laws Republicans were opposed to. They noted that it focused heavily on mental illness without addressing other indicators of violence and would require a waiting period before a court hearing, rather than allowing for immediate intervention. ¡°Those with mental illness are not disproportionately committing violence,¡± said Dr. April Zeoli, a top researcher at the University of Michigan Institute for Firearm Injury Prevention. ¡°It doesn¡¯t target the people who are committing the majority of violence, so it¡¯s not going to tip the scales that much in terms of gun violence, and it¡¯s only going to harm the community with mental illness.¡± Lisa Geller, a co-director of the Extreme Risk Protection Order Resource Center at Johns Hopkins University, said even if the draft measure had become law, she would not count Tennessee among the states that had a so-called red flag law. Ms. Geller said that the longer that the Tennessee legislature waits, and the longer that other state legislatures go without red flag laws or other protections in place, ¡°the more tragedies that are going to happen in their states.¡± Emily Cochrane is a national correspondent covering the American South, based in Nashville.

https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/21/us/politics/tennessee-gun-law-nashville-shooting.html?searchResultPosition=19,2023-08-21,Grieving Governor¡¯s Moderate Gun Proposal Is Spurned by G.O.P. Allies,"Tennessee¡¯s Republican governor called a special session to address public safety in the wake of a school shooting, but his own party is set to thwart his key measure. By Emily Cochrane Reporting from Nashville When Gov. Bill Lee of Tennessee began a push in April to address public safety, his family was grieving the loss of two close friends, both educators killed in a mass shooting at a Nashville Christian school. His call for millions of dollars to harden school security was embraced by Republicans in the legislature, who flanked him during a formal announcement. But days later, when Mr. Lee, a Republican, decided to go further and ask for an order of protection law that could temporarily restrict an individual¡¯s access to firearms, he stood alone for the announcement. The legislature would wrap up its work by the end of the month without taking a vote to pass it. Now, Mr. Lee has summoned lawmakers back to Nashville on Monday for a special session on public safety that could include consideration of a limited version of the law. But without the support of most in his own party, that measure appears, once again, destined for failure, underscoring the power dynamics of a Republican supermajority driven by a right-wing base hardened against any potential infringement on gun ownership. ¡°There¡¯s issues that, really, the governor might have an opinion on, but the majority of the legislature has another opinion,¡± said Lt. Gov. Randy McNally, one of the few Republican lawmakers to openly back Mr. Lee¡¯s proposal. He added, ¡°It just sometimes takes time, and sometimes won¡¯t happen.¡± In the lead up to the special session, Mr. Lee and senior Republicans have instead prioritized legislation that focuses on shoring up mental health resources and policy, toughening criminal penalties for threats of mass violence, targeting juvenile crime and incentivizing the safe storage of firearms. Some experts have warned that the supermajority¡¯s stance leaves open the possibility that the legislature¡¯s work will do little to stem the toll of gun violence, the leading cause of death for American children, and may exacerbate existing inequalities in the state. ¡°We need to get away from asking ourselves if anything is going to be good enough and really ask ourselves if the policies that are being put forward are going to be effective, and if they will not be harmful to vulnerable communities,¡± said Jen Pauliukonis, the director of policy and programming at the Center for Gun Violence Solutions at Johns Hopkins University. The March 27 shooting at the Covenant School devastated Nashville, leaving three 9-year-old students and three adults dead. The assailant legally purchased seven firearms and had been under treatment for an emotional disorder before opening fire in the school. (The shooting remains under investigation.) The painfully familiar tragedy prompted days of impassioned gun control protests, as thousands of students, parents and teachers demanded that Republicans take substantial steps to restrict access to guns in the state. But by the end of April, the Republican supermajority had expelled two young Black Democrats for leading a protest from the House floor ? both have since won re-election ? and punted any legislative action dealing directly with firearm access. Mr. Lee quickly said he would ask the legislature to return to tackle public safety, even as his central proposal, a limited version of a ¡°red flag law¡± that could allow a judge to temporarily confiscate weapons from people determined to be a possible threat to themselves or others, was vilified by Republicans as an assault on constitutional rights. This is not the first time Mr. Lee¡¯s policy agenda has been shaped by personal loss and a deep-rooted Christian faith: In his memoir and on the campaign trail, he has described the trauma and recovery within his family after the sudden death of his first wife in a horseback-riding accident. In his first Republican primary, he slipped past a bitter battle between more established politicians and then continued to lean on his personal experiences and appeal as an outside businessman to clinch his first political office and the governor¡¯s mansion. Unlike some of his predecessors, Mr. Lee has maintained a low profile, signing off on several far-right priorities with little fanfare or publicity. Before the Covenant shooting, he had championed gun rights, including a law allowing people 21 and older to carry handguns without a permit in public. ¡°I¡¯m one who believes that if we focus on what we believe can get done, if we focus on what we all can agree upon, then we will get something done that will make our state safer,¡± he told reporters this month. But some observers applauded Mr. Lee for ignoring complaints from within his party and pushing ahead with the special session. ¡°We didn¡¯t ask for this moment, but we know the special session can bring about much-needed change as we head into another school year,¡± said Kramer Schmidt, one of several Covenant School parents who praised Mr. Lee for following through. Though his limited gun control measure has support outside the legislature ? a Vanderbilt University poll this summer showed that about three-quarters of registered voters were in favor of a red-flag law ? most elections in Tennessee are decided in the Republican primaries. And the state¡¯s conservative bent and intense gerrymandering have given the far-right portion of the electorate outsize influence. ¡°Everybody wants to keep focusing on the gun, but there¡¯s a lot of other things out there that we think that we should do and can do that would be very beneficial,¡± House Speaker Cameron Sexton said in an interview. ¡°The issue is the person,¡± he added. ¡°A lot of times we want to focus on the weapon, but we need to focus on the person.¡± John Harris, the executive director of the Tennessee Firearms Association, said Mr. Lee had decided to ¡°throw the entire pan of spaghetti up on the wall, and let¡¯s see what sticks.¡± ¡°Governor Lee has made no effort, publicly or otherwise, we¡¯re aware of to try to show that what he¡¯s proposing meets the standard that the Supreme Court has established, at least with respect to the Second Amendment proposals,¡± he said. Democrats said they would introduce their own legislation, including a tougher order of protection law. None of their measures are likely to receive serious consideration. ¡°He¡¯s put himself in a corner,¡± Representative John Ray Clemmons of Nashville, the chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, said of the governor. Like several other Democrats, Mr. Clemmons blamed far-right Republicans for pressuring the legislature to veer away from gun control. ¡°Not only do they not care enough to actually have an adult conversation about it, clearly, they¡¯re going to try to use it as a tool or a vehicle to sneak through a whole bunch of other crappy stuff in three days,¡± he said.

Emily Cochrane,?Ben Shpigel,?Michael Levenson and Jesus Jim?nez NASHVILLE ? A 28-year-old from Nashville fatally shot three children and three adults on Monday at a private Christian elementary school, officials said, leaving behind writings and detailed maps of the school and its security protocols. In the latest episode of gun violence that has devastated American families and communities, the assailant opened fire just after 10 a.m. inside the Covenant School, in the affluent Green Hills neighborhood, where children in preschool through sixth grade had just begun their final full week of classes before Easter break. The shooter, who the police identified as Audrey E. Hale, had entered the building by firing through a side door, armed with two assault-style weapons and a handgun, according to John Drake, the chief of the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department, and went to the second floor, firing shots before being killed by the police. Chief Drake said that the assailant was ¡°at one point a student¡± at the school. Surveillance video released by the police on Monday night showed the shooter drive up to the school in what the police described as a Honda Fit. In the clip, two sets of glass doors shatter from bullets before the assailant ducks into the building through the broken glass. Wearing camouflage pants, a black vest and a backward red baseball cap, the assailant walks through rooms and hallways with a weapon drawn. At one point, the shooter can be seen walking in and out of the church office and down a hallway past the children¡¯s ministry, as the lights of what appear to be a fire alarm flash. There was confusion about the gender identity of the assailant in the immediate aftermath of the attack. Chief Drake said the shooter identified as transgender. Officials used ¡°she¡± and ¡°her¡± to refer to the shooter, but, according to a social media post and a LinkedIn profile, the shooter appeared to identify as male in recent months. The police in Nashville identified the six victims as Evelyn Dieckhaus, Hallie Scruggs and William Kinney, all 9; Cynthia Peak, 61, a substitute teacher; Mike Hill, 61, a custodian; and Katherine Koonce, 60. Dr. Koonce was the head of school, according to the school website. Hallie Scruggs was the daughter of Chad Scruggs, the pastor of Covenant Presbyterian Church, according to a biography published online by his former church in Dallas. Covenant Presbyterian is connected to the elementary school. Chief Drake said it was too early to discuss a possible motive for the shooting, though he confirmed that the attack was targeted. The authorities were reviewing writings, and had made contact with the shooter¡¯s father, Chief Drake said. ¡°We have a map drawn out of how this was all going to take place,¡± he said. ¡°There¡¯s right now a theory that we may be able to talk about later but it¡¯s not confirmed, so we¡¯ll put that out as soon as we can.¡± The shooting shattered the wealthy enclave of Green Hills, a few miles south of downtown Nashville, where the small school and stone church sit atop a hill, nestled in a residential neighborhood filled with stately homes and lush landscaping. Founded in 2001 as a ministry of the Covenant Presbyterian Church, the Covenant School bills itself as ¡°intentionally small¡± with about 200 students, according to its website, and a student-to-teacher ratio of 8 to 1. Tuition costs around $16,000 per year. Sirens and the buzz of helicopters pierced the still of a sunny spring morning on Monday, sending residents of the area out of their homes to wait for news about the shooting or assurances that their children at neighboring schools had been released from lockdown. A few women gathered around a livestream of the news conference, gasping and shaking their heads. ¡°It¡¯s terrifying when you see parents running up the hill,¡± said Lisa DeBusk, 43, who lives in Green Hills. She said she had considered sending her daughter to Covenant, calling it ¡°the sweetest, most wonderful place.¡± ¡°We¡¯re all resilient, but we shouldn¡¯t have to be in this,¡± she added. ¡°I never would have imagined this.¡± By The New York Times The police received a report of the shooting at 10:13 a.m. and heard gunshots on the second floor when they arrived at the school, a police spokesman, Don Aaron, said. Officers went there, saw the assailant shooting, and two of the officers opened fire, killing the assailant at 10:27 a.m. in a ¡°lobby-type area¡± on the second floor, Mr. Aaron said. The school does not have a police officer guarding it, he said. Kendra Loney, a spokeswoman for the Nashville Fire Department, said that schoolchildren and members of the school¡¯s staff were escorted out of the building after the shooting, and that a total of 108 people had been transported to the nearby Woodmont Baptist Church. The pupils ? dressed in the school uniform of red and black polo shirts, plaid skirts and khaki shorts and pants ? held hands as they walked from the buses, escorted by the police, into a conference-like room inside the church. Elsewhere in the building, parents waited to learn if their children were safe. Rachael Anne Elrod, the Metro Nashville School Board chair, said she was inside ¡°the worst waiting room you can imagine¡± as officials set about reuniting children with their parents. Some, she said, were debating how to manage the rest of the day after such a traumatic morning. ¡°They are mostly figuring out how they are going to talk to their children going forward about this,¡± Ms. Elrod said. ¡°What is the next best step? What should they do next? Do we take them to get ice cream? Take them to the playground? Do we ask them what they saw? Do we not ask them what they saw? Do we bring them to school tomorrow? Is there school tomorrow?¡± Rachel Dibble, whose children attend a different private school in Nashville, had also visited with Covenant families, some of whom she knew through youth sports. ¡°It has to stop,¡± Ms. Dibble said of school shootings. ¡°I want a politician to sit in a church with families and 250 kids downstairs that are white as a sheet and trembling and gray and yellow and green and blue because of the shock.¡± Speaking of the students, she added: ¡°They started this morning, they had their cute little uniforms on, they probably had some Froot Loops. Their whole lives changed today.¡± There is no consensus on what constitutes a mass shooting; groups define it differently, depending on the circumstances. But the Gun Violence Archive, a nonprofit research group that tracks gun violence using police reports, news coverage and other public sources, defines a mass shooting as one in which at least four people are killed or injured. As of late March, the archive has counted 130 mass shootings in the United States in 2023. Calling the Nashville shooting ¡°sick¡± and ¡°a family¡¯s worst nightmare,¡± President Biden again pushed Congress on Monday to enact gun-control legislation. He has repeatedly called for such a ban on assault weapons, including during his recent visit to Monterey Park, Calif., where a gunman killed 11 people at a dance studio in January. ¡°It¡¯s about time that we begin to make some progress,¡± Mr. Biden said. Even as school shootings become more frequent, the shooting at Covenant was unusual. Many of the highest-profile school shootings in recent years have taken place at public schools, in part because there are far more public schools in the United States: nearly 100,000, compared with about 30,000 private schools. Shootings at elementary schools are also relatively uncommon, making up less than 20 percent of all incidents of gun violence on school grounds, according to the K-12 School Shooting Database. Most incidents of gun violence on school campuses, including active shooter incidents, happen at high schools. After spending time in Woodmont Baptist, Melissa Trevathan, the owner of a counseling ministry, grieved the loss of Dr. Koonce, whom she said she had gotten to know through her work with children. Ms. Trevathan, who had come with Pippa, a therapy dog in training, to offer support, characterized Dr. Koonce as ¡°very magnetic¡± and strong, and recalled her passion for education, sense of humor and love for adventure. ¡°She would go the ultimate in protecting her kids,¡± Ms. Trevathan said.

Demonstrating how frequent such shootings have become, her family happened to be on a vacation in Tennessee visiting her sister-in-law on Monday when yet another shooting took place in their vicinity, this one claiming the lives of three children and three adults. ¡°How is this still happening? How are our children still dying, and why are we failing them?¡± she said to the reporters gathered. ¡°We have to do something,¡± she added, urging people to call their representatives. ¡°This is going to keep happening. It¡¯s going to be your kid and your kid and your kid and your kid next because it¡¯s just a matter of time.¡± Ms. Beasley said that since surviving the shooting in July, which left seven dead and more than 30 injured, she had been lobbying for gun safety legislation in Washington, meeting with more than 130 lawmakers. In an interview with ABC¡¯s Nightline that month, she described how her son, who was then 6, seemed to freeze with fear when the shots rang out and the panicked crowd began running to safety. The mother and son weren¡¯t hurt. ¡°He wouldn¡¯t run,¡± she said. ¡°He cowered and screamed he didn¡¯t want to get shot, he didn¡¯t want to die.¡± The look on his face was ¡°indescribable,¡± she recounted. ¡°It was such a sheer primal sense of terror.¡±   Eliza Fawcett,?Ruth Graham and Emily Cochrane Details are still emerging about the six people killed in a mass shooting on Monday at the Covenant School in Nashville. Of the three 9-year-old children whose lives were abruptly ended, one was Hallie Scruggs; she was the daughter of Chad Scruggs, the pastor of Covenant Presbyterian Church, according to a biography published online by his former church in Dallas. The other two were identified as Evelyn Dieckhaus and William Kinney.  And the three adults killed included Cynthia Peak, 61, a substitute teacher; Mike Hill, 61, a custodian at the school; and Katherine Koonce, 60, Covenant¡¯s head. In a message on its website, Dr. Koonce said the school wanted to help students ¡°challenge their thinking and help them learn critical skills.¡± ¡°We are about more than simply educating our students ? we are participating in the miracle of their development and seeing them transform into who they will be,¡± she wrote.  Joseph Fisher, a truck driver, learned of Dr. Koonce¡¯s death while driving between Arizona and Utah. Stunned, he parked his truck and walked up a mountainside.  Dr. Koonce served as his math tutor when he was a home-schooled middle schooler, he said, and the two worked together at a school just a short drive from Covenant, Christ Presbyterian Academy.  He remembered her going carefully through each page of a math lesson, making sure that he understood every problem. When his mind drifted, she reeled him back in.  She motivated him to keep pushing through challenges, he said, constantly reminding him, ¡°Joe: You can do this. You¡¯ve got it.¡±  ¡°She just believed that I have more to give ? and I did,¡± he said. Melissa Trevathan, 74, said she had known Dr. Koonce for years, in part because of Ms. Trevathan¡¯s work with children as the owner of a counseling business. She recalled Dr. Koonce¡¯s passion for education, her sense of humor and love for adventure. ¡°She would be quiet, but yet very magnetic at the same time,¡± Ms. Trevathan said. Daniel Diermeier, the chancellor of Vanderbilt University, in Nashville, said in an email to alumni that Dr. Koonce was a 1985 graduate of the university¡¯s Peabody College of Education and Human Development.  He said he was ¡°horrified and deeply saddened¡± by the shooting, which he called ¡°a tragedy for the city of Nashville and its many communities, including here at Vanderbilt ? from members of our community who have children, or know children or staff, at Covenant to colleagues and fellow students at Vanderbilt University Medical Center who cared for the victims as well as families with school-age children who are, once again, hearing of an act of violence on school grounds.¡±  Ruth Graham Covenant Presbyterian Church, which founded and housed the Covenant School, is a prominent church affiliated with the Presbyterian Church in America, a theologically conservative denomination. The Presbyterian Church in America, an evangelical group founded in the 1970s, broke from a larger Presbyterian body over issues including the ordination of women, which the P.C.A. opposes. In 2019, the denomination affirmed what is called the Nashville Statement, a conservative statement on sexuality and gender, as a ¡°biblically faithful declaration.¡± The denomination¡¯s own report on gender and sexuality, prepared in 2020, refers to ¡°the sinfulness of homosexual and transgender desire as well as conduct.¡± At one point, Covenant Presbyterian Church had as many as 2,200 members, according to the online biography of a former pastor, Jim Bachmann. It built a $15.5 million hilltop sanctuary in the wealthy Green Hills neighborhood of Nashville in the late 2000s, including a pipe organ, an unusual feature in a newly constructed church. It opened the school, which is attached, in 2001. Mr. Bachmann said he decided to open the school in part because parents in the church lamented the difficulty of getting their children into other private schools in the area, which were already full. Mr. Bachmann said the shooting was ¡°gut-wrenching¡± for all in the community. As for the church and its teachings, Mr. Bachmann said, ¡°we were known to be conservative and biblical.¡± ¡°You try to be loving of everybody, but the position of the Presbyterian Church in America is that homosexuality is a sin,¡± he said. But Mr. Bachmann said he rarely mentioned the issue in his preaching, and emphasized that ¡°it¡¯s one sin, and there¡¯s a lot of sins: Pride¡¯s a sin, envy¡¯s a sin, covetousness is a sin.¡± The church underwent a period of turmoil after a leadership struggle in the mid-2010s, but maintained its stature in the broader denomination. The current pastor is Chad Scruggs, whose 9-year-old daughter, Hallie, was killed in the shooting. Mr. Scruggs was raised Catholic in Hendersonville, Tenn., according to a biography published online by his former church in Dallas, but became active in a Presbyterian campus ministry in college. Ligon Duncan, the chancellor and chief executive of Reformed Theological Seminary, which trains many Presbyterian pastors, knows Mr. Scruggs through Presbyterian circles. ¡°The children adore him, he adores his wife,¡± Mr. Duncan said in an interview on Monday. ¡°They look wonderful in a picture, but they are really like that.¡± Covenant is ¡°a very well known church¡± within the denomination, said Kevin DeYoung, the pastor of another prominent P.C.A. congregation, Christ Covenant Church in Matthews, N.C. ¡°Everyone knows of that church, and many people know Chad.¡± For now, he said, he was doing the only thing he could. ¡°People will be praying for Covenant Presbyterian, for Chad and for that school,¡± he said. ¡°We pray it¡¯s an opportunity to show how the gospel gives us a hope the world can¡¯t understand.¡± Mr. DeYoung¡¯s church, too, has a school attached to it. That school has grown more concerned about safety. It recently added a second full-time security officer and locks all its doors during the day. On Monday afternoon, he was preparing for a previously planned annual meeting about the school, which he anticipated would now be consumed by questions about security, given the shattering impact of the shooting within the denomination. In a statement for the national denomination, a spokesman, Bryan Chapell, said, ¡°We grieve the loss and trauma associated with this horrible tragedy. May God comfort all who mourn.¡±  Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs The attacker who fatally shot three children and three staff members at a Nashville school on Monday was identified as a former student at the school who the police said appeared to have written a manifesto about the attack and drawn maps of the campus. The shooter, identified as Audrey E. Hale, was killed by police officers who responded to the shooting at the Covenant School, a small, private Christian school that is attached to a church and serves children from pre-school through sixth grade. The Nashville police chief, John Drake, said the police had found maps of the school that were drawn ¡°in detail¡± and which noted the location of school surveillance cameras, entry points and other features. He said the police were in touch with the shooter¡¯s father, and that it was not immediately clear when the assailant had attended the school. The attacker entered the school by shooting through one of the doors, the authorities said, and was armed with three guns, including an AR-style rifle, an AR-style pistol and a handgun. At least two were purchased legally in the Nashville area, the police said. The assailant was ¡°prepared for a confrontation with law enforcement¡± and ¡°prepared to do more harm¡± before being killed, Mr. Drake said. There was confusion about the gender identity of the assailant in the immediate aftermath of the attack. Officials used ¡°she¡± and ¡°her¡± to refer to the shooter, and Chief Drake said that the assailant identified as transgender.  Kristin Mumford, a police spokeswoman, said that the shooter had been born female but listed male pronouns on a LinkedIn profile, which suggested that the suspect was a transgender man. That profile had been active in recent months, with the user reacting to two posts about other people¡¯s career updates. In response to a reporter¡¯s question about whether the attacker¡¯s gender identity was connected to the shooting, Chief Drake said, ¡°We¡¯re investigating all the leads.¡± The attacker was an illustrator and graphic designer who had studied at the Nossi College of Art and Design, according to a former teacher and an online portfolio.  ¡°She just always was a kind of quiet girl but was very serious about her work,¡± said Steve LaSuer, an instructor at the school who had taught the attacker in a design and composition in 2015 or 2016. Mr. LaSuer said he had been stunned by Monday¡¯s developments. ¡°It¡¯s blown me away,¡± he said. The online portfolio included illustrations related to businesses around Nashville, including logos and splashy advertisements for a restaurant, a toy store and a video company. Beginning last May, the shooter worked as a shopper for a grocery delivery company, according to a LinkedIn profile.  Kitty Bennett and Kirsten Noyes contributed research.  Katie Rogers WASHINGTON ? President Biden addressed the deadly shooting in Nashville on Monday, calling the deaths of six people, including three elementary school children,  ¡°a family¡¯s worst nightmare,¡± and urging Congress to enact gun-control legislation.  ¡°The shooter in this situation reportedly had two assault weapons and a pistol,¡± Mr. Biden said during a small-business event at the White House, referring to reports by local officials. ¡°So I call on Congress, again, to pass my assault weapons ban. It¡¯s about time that we begin to make some progress.¡±  Mr. Biden has repeatedly called for such a ban in recent public speeches and visits, including during a recent visit to Monterey Park, Calif., where a gunman killed 11 people at a dance studio in January. His remarks on Monday once again highlighted not only the scourge of mass shootings in America, but also the limits of his power to address them.  Even with majorities in both houses of Congress during Mr. Biden¡¯s first two years in office, Democrats were unable to pass a ban, and any effort now would be all but certain to die in the Republican-controlled House. That has left Mr. Biden with few options but the bully pulpit.   As a senator in 1994, Mr. Biden negotiated a 10-year assault weapons ban as part of a broader crime bill. That led to a temporary drop in gun crime and shootings of police officers, according to a study by the Justice Department. The ban blocked the sale of 19 weapons similar to those used by the United States military, including semiautomatic rifles and certain types of shotguns and handguns, and it was opposed by Republicans and the National Rifle Association. Last summer, Congress passed a bipartisan bill that bolstered background checks for potential gun buyers under the age of 21 and pumped federal money into states to put in place so-called red flag laws, which allow officials to temporarily confiscate guns from people found in court to be unfit to possess them. Last month, the Justice Department announced a $200 million program to fund state crisis intervention programs in an effort to reduce gun violence.  The bill was considered a compromise, and Democrats said it fell far short of the sort of assault weapons ban that Mr. Biden has proposed. This year, Republican lawmakers have introduced several bills that would expand access to guns, including a proposal backed by Senate Republicans that would codify the right of Americans to carry guns outside of their homes and use them for self-defense.  Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, told reporters at a news briefing on Monday that there were no plans for Mr. Biden to address congressional Republicans directly on the issue.  ¡°The president calls on Congress to do something before another child is senselessly killed in another act of gun violence,¡± Ms. Jean-Pierre said.  Later on Monday, President Biden issued a proclamation in remembrance of those killed on Monday, ordering flags to be lowered to half-staff at the White House, at public buildings and at all military station until Friday at sunset. Earlier this month, the Gun Violence Archive, a nonprofit research group, said that, since the beginning of the year, the United States had surpassed 100 mass shootings, defined as those in which at least four people were killed or injured.   Ben Shpigel The shooting at a Christian school in Nashville on Monday in which six people, including three children, were killed, prompted an outpouring of condolences that spanned party lines ? but also a big dose of frustration that gun violence continues to plague American life. ¡°Enough is enough,¡± Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, said Monday. How many children have to be murdered before Republicans will support passing an assault weapons ban, she asked. Kris Brown, the president of Brady: United Against Gun Violence, one of the country¡¯s oldest gun control groups, denounced the frequency of mass shootings and urged people never to grow inured to them. ¡°We do not have to live like this, nor should we ever accept this as our reality,¡± Ms. Brown said in a statement. ¡°Our children deserve a life free from worry of being gunned down while learning their ABC¡¯s.¡±  Representative Andy Ogles, Republican of Tennessee, who represents the district where the Covenant School is, said that he and his family were ¡°devastated by the tragedy¡± and that, as a father of three, he was particularly distraught by ¡°this senseless act of violence.¡± In 2021, Mr. Ogles posted a photo of his family to Facebook with he and his wife ? and two of his three children ? holding firearms. Senator Marsha Blackburn, Republican of Tennessee, said on Twitter that she was ¡°heartbroken,¡± and that her office had been in contact with the authorities.  Sarah Mervosh The Covenant School in Nashville is a small, private Christian school, with an enrollment of around 200 students in preschool through sixth grade. The school is ¡°intentionally small¡± with an emphasis on relationships, according to its website, and the school boasts a student-to-teacher ratio of 8-to-1. Tuition costs around $16,000 a year. The school was founded in 2001 as a ministry of the Covenant Presbyterian Church, according to the school¡¯s website. The two share a location. Even as school shootings become more frequent, the shooting at Covenant was unusual on several counts. Many of the highest-profile school shootings in recent years have taken place at public schools, in part because there are far more public schools in the United States: Nearly 100,000, compared to about 30,000 private schools. Shootings at elementary schools are also relatively uncommon, making up less than 20 percent of all incidents of gun violence on school grounds, according to the K-12 School Shooting Database. Most incidents of gun violence on school campuses, including active shooter incidents, happen at high schools. Still, the shooting in Nashville was just one of several instances of gun violence on school campuses in the last week alone. A 16-year-old was fatally shot last Monday morning before classes began at a high school in Arlington, Texas. On Wednesday, a 17-year-old student shot two administrators and later killed himself in Denver. While those involved fewer than four victims and so were not considered mass shootings, ¡°every one of these incidents has a profound impact on everyone involved in the entire school shooting, and they are happening, like, every day,¡± said David Riedman, the researcher behind the K-12 School Shooting Database, which tracks gun incidents on school grounds and has found campus gun violence to be increasing in frequency. More than 270 people were fatally shot or wounded in shootings on school grounds last year, compared to 159 in 2018, the year of the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., according to the database.  Michael Levenson Investigators were reviewing video footage from the Christian school in Nashville where an assailant fatally shot three children and three staff members on Monday morning, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department said at a news conference. The attacker, who was identified by the police as a 28-year-old from Nashville named Audrey Hale, had entered the Covenant School through a side door, armed with two assault-style rifles and a handgun, the spokesman, Don Aaron, said at the news conference. The school does not have a police officer guarding it, Mr. Aaron said. The attacker went from the first floor to the second floor, firing ¡°multiple shots,¡± Mr. Aaron said. The police received a report of the shooting at 10:13 a.m., and heard gunshots on the second floor, he said. Officers went there, saw the assailant shooting, and two officers opened fire, killing the shooter at 10:27 a.m. in a ¡°lobby-type area¡± on the second floor, Mr. Aaron said. ¡°There is video from the school that we are viewing now to try to learn how exactly all of this happened,¡± Mr. Aaron said. Kendra Loney, a spokeswoman for the Nashville Fire Department, said that schoolchildren and members of the school¡¯s staff were escorted out of the building after the shooting. Two buses carried a total of 108 children and staff members to a nearby church, Woodmont Baptist, where parents had been asked to reunite with their children, Ms. Loney said. Mental health counselors were there to meet the families, she said.  Emily Cochrane and Jamie McGee A few blocks from the Covenant School, parents and neighbors trickled out of their homes in disbelief as they waited for news about the shooting or word that their children at neighboring schools had been released from lockdown. A few women clustered around a livestream of the news conference, where they gasped in horror and shook their heads, wondering out loud how this could have happened in Nashville. The sirens ? more than usual, considering the nearby fire station ? and the sound of helicopters had been the first sign that something was wrong. Lisa DeBusk, 43, said she had considered sending her daughter to the school, calling it ¡°the sweetest, most wonderful place.¡± She had spent part of the morning instead on text threads and reaching out to friends and neighbors who had children there. ¡°It¡¯s terrifying when you see parents running up the hill,¡± Ms. DeBusk said, calling it ¡°the most horrifying thing¡± she had seen.  ¡°We¡¯re all resilient, but we shouldn¡¯t have to be in this,¡± she added. ¡°I never would have imagined this.¡± The Nashville Fire Department said on Twitter that a reunification area had been set up at a nearby church for parents to meet their children. Children and teachers descended one by one from the steps of three school buses into a church building two miles from the Covenant School to reunite with parents. A first-grade teacher hugged her fianc? outside the church building, and elementary-age children, dressed in red and black polo shirts, plaid skirts and khaki pants and shorts, held hands to form a chain as they walked from the bus into the church building while escorted by the police.",NYT

By Adam Liptak and Glenn Thrush Reporting from Washington The Supreme Court agreed on Friday to consider whether the government may forbid people subject to domestic violence orders from having guns, setting up a major test of its ruling last year vastly expanding people¡¯s right to arm themselves in public. The case will turn on the scope of a new legal standard established in that decision, one whose reliance on historical practices has sown confusion as courts have struggled to apply it, with some judges sweeping aside gun controls that have been on the books for decades. It comes as the nation struggles to address a seemingly unending series of mass shootings and other gun violence, and about a year after Congress briefly broke its partisan deadlock to pass a modest bipartisan gun control law. Last year, in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen, the court, by a 6-to-3 vote, struck down a New York law that placed strict limits on carrying guns outside the home. The court¡¯s decision to hear a Second Amendment case in its next term was seen by lawyers on both sides of the issue as an attempt to define the parameters of the Bruen ruling, and to perhaps provide a clearer set of standards. Noah Lumbantobing, a spokesman for March for Our Lives, which was founded by students following the mass shooting in Parkland, Fla. in 2018, said that in taking up the case, the court would have ¡°an opportunity to clean up some of the legal mess¡± from last year. Some conservative legal experts have expressed concern that the court will end up curbing last year¡¯s decision. Stephen Halbrook, a lawyer who has argued gun cases before the court, recently described the case as a ¡°bad vehicle¡± to do so because the defendant, Zackey Rahimi, appeared unsuited to owning a firearm under any circumstances. The Supreme Court has issued only two significant Second Amendment decisions since 2008, when it established an individual right to keep guns in the home for self-defense in District of Columbia v. Heller. Two years later, in McDonald v. Chicago, the court extended the Heller decision, which concerned federal gun laws, to state and local ones. More than a decade of silence followed, with the court turning down countless appeals of decisions upholding gun control laws, to the frustration of some of its conservative members. The arrival of three justices appointed by President Donald J. Trump, which established a conservative supermajority, changed the calculus. The court¡¯s rationale in the Bruen ruling was as important as its outcome. The majority opinion, written by Justice Clarence Thomas, announced a new standard by which courts must now judge restrictions on gun rights, turning to early American history as a guide: ¡°The government must demonstrate that the regulation is consistent with this nation¡¯s historical tradition of firearm regulation.¡± The constitutionality of modern gun control measures, he wrote, depends on whether there were analogous laws during the 18th and 19th centuries. Justice Thomas acknowledged that the new standard was inexact. ¡°Analogical reasoning requires only that the government identify a well-established and representative historical analogue, not a historical twin,¡± Justice Thomas wrote. ¡°So even if a modern-day regulation is not a dead ringer for historical precursors, it still may be analogous enough to pass constitutional muster.¡± In March, a unanimous three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, said that new standard required it to strike down a federal law prohibiting people subject to domestic violence orders from possessing firearms because there was no historical support for it. The case, United States v. Rahimi, No. 22-915, concerns Mr. Rahimi, a drug dealer in Texas with a history of armed violence, according to court records. In 2019, Mr. Rahimi assaulted his girlfriend and threatened to shoot her if she told anyone, leading her to obtain a restraining order. The order suspended Mr. Rahimi¡¯s handgun license and prohibited him from possessing firearms. He threatened a different woman with a gun, leading to charges of assault with a deadly weapon. Then, in the space of two months, he opened fire in public five times. Upset about a social media post from someone to whom he had sold drugs, for instance, he shot an AR-15 rifle into his former client¡¯s home. When a fast-food restaurant declined a friend¡¯s credit card, he fired several bullets into the air. The shootings led to a search warrant of Mr. Rahimi¡¯s home, which uncovered weapons, and he was charged with violating the federal law. After a judge rejected his Second Amendment challenge to the law, he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to more than six years in prison. The Fifth Circuit initially affirmed his conviction in a short decision, rebuffing the argument that the law violated the Second Amendment in a footnote. But the appeals court?reversed course after the Bruen decision last June. The Fifth Circuit rejected a variety of old laws identified by the government as possible historical analogues, saying they did not sufficiently resemble the one concerning domestic violence orders. Many of them, Judge Cory T. Wilson wrote for the panel, ¡°disarmed classes of people considered to be dangerous, specifically including those unwilling to take an oath of allegiance, slaves and Native Americans.¡± That was different, he wrote, from domestic violence orders, which make case-by-case judgments about a particular individual¡¯s dangerousness. Judge Wilson, who was appointed by Mr. Trump, wrote that the government¡¯s insistence that it could disarm people who were not law-abiding ¡°admits to no true limiting principle.¡± ¡°Could speeders be stripped of their right to keep and bear arms?¡± he asked. ¡°Political nonconformists? People who do not recycle or drive an electric vehicle?¡± Judge Wilson acknowledged that the federal law at issue in the case ¡°embodies salutary policy goals meant to protect vulnerable people in our society.¡± But he said the approach required by the Bruen decision did not allow courts to weigh the benefits of the law against its burdens. What was significant, he wrote, quoting that decision, was that ¡°our ancestors would never have accepted¡± the law on domestic violence orders. Judge James C. Ho, who was also appointed by Mr. Trump, issued a concurring opinion saying there were other ways to protect victims of domestic abuse. ¡°Those who commit violence, including domestic violence,¡± he wrote, ¡°shouldn¡¯t just be disarmed ? they should be detained, prosecuted, convicted and incarcerated. And that¡¯s exactly why we have a criminal justice system ? to punish criminals and disable them from engaging in further crimes.¡± But Judge Ho said domestic violence orders were products of the civil justice system and were subject to abuse. ¡°That makes it difficult to justify¡± the law Mr. Rahimi challenged, he wrote, ¡°as a measure to disarm dangerous individuals.¡± Dissenting in the Bruen case last year, Justice Stephen G. Breyer wrote that the new test asked judges to perform unfamiliar tasks. Judges are not historians, wrote Justice Breyer, who retired a few days later. ¡°Legal experts typically have little experience answering contested historical questions or applying those answers to resolve contemporary problems,¡± he wrote.

https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/11/us/illinois-supreme-court-guns.html?searchResultPosition=23,2023-08-11,Illinois Supreme Court Clears Way for State¡¯s Sharp Gun Limits,"By Julie Bosman Reporting from Chicago The Illinois Supreme Court on Friday upheld the state¡¯s ban on certain high-powered guns, including AR-15-style rifles, a major victory for supporters of gun limits in the state. The legislation, which Gov. J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat, signed into law in January, is the broadest set of gun restrictions in the Midwest. The ban garnered wide support among Democratic legislators, who control the state legislature, after a mass shooting in Highland Park, Ill., in 2022, when a gunman killed seven people and wounded dozens more with a high-powered rifle at a Fourth of July parade. Once the law was passed, Illinois became one of 10 states with some form of what advocates call an assault weapons ban, according to the Giffords Law Center, which supports gun restrictions. Residents of Illinois are no longer allowed to purchase many types of semiautomatic weapons, including AR-15-style rifles, though exceptions were carved out for retired and current police and military personnel and prison wardens. People who already own weapons that are now banned were given a deadline to register them with the Illinois State Police. Illinois residents who wish to own a firearm are already required to be licensed by the State Police. Dan Caulkins, a Republican state representative, led a group of gun owners who argued that the ban violated a State Constitution requirement that laws apply equally to all people. On Friday, the Illinois Supreme Court voted 4 to 3 to keep the law in place, finding that it did not violate the Constitution¡¯s equal protection clause by creating exemptions for law enforcement professionals and people who already own banned weapons. ¡°The equal protection clause does not forbid the legislature from drawing distinctions in legislation among different categories of people as long as the legislature does not draw those distinctions based on criteria wholly unrelated to the legislation¡¯s purpose,¡± the court ruled. From the beginning, the gun ban prompted challenges from Republicans, especially in conservative counties in Downstate Illinois, where some sheriffs have said that they will not fully enforce the new law. Illinois has some of the strictest gun restrictions in the country, but state-by-state firearms laws have their limits. Officials in Chicago have long pointed to neighboring Indiana, with its looser gun laws, as the source of illegally obtained guns that are used in shootings in Chicago. Opponents of the Illinois law have also pointed to a U.S. Supreme Court decision in a New York case last year as evidence that wide-ranging gun bans in Illinois will not withstand scrutiny. In that case, New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen, the high court found that Americans had a broad right to arm themselves in public and struck down a New York law that placed strict limits on carrying guns outside the home. Mr. Pritzker praised Friday¡¯s ruling, calling the gun ban a ¡°common sense gun reform law to keep mass-killing machines off of our streets and out of our schools, malls, parks and places of worship.¡± ¡°This decision is a win for advocates, survivors and families alike because it preserves this nation-leading legislation to combat gun violence and save countless lives,¡± the governor said in a statement. The law still faces challenges before a federal appeals court. Several federal lawsuits are still pending before the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in Chicago, with the plaintiffs arguing that such sweeping firearms restrictions are a violation of the Second Amendment. Richard Pearson, the executive director of the Illinois State Rifle Association, an organization that supports gun rights, said in a statement that the court¡¯s decision was ¡°no surprise.¡± The group hopes to challenge the law in front of the U.S. Supreme Court, he said, which will ¡°prove to be a victory not just for law-abiding gun owners in Illinois, but across the country.¡± Julie Bosman is the Chicago bureau chief of The Times, reporting on the Midwest.

https://www.nytimes.com/explain/2023/gun-control/where-does-the-us-public-stand-on-the-issue?searchResultPosition=24,2023-01-26,"Gun Control, Explained","A quick guide to the debate over gun legislation in the United States. By The New York Times As the number of mass shootings in America continues to rise, gun control ? a term used to describe a wide range of restrictions and measures aimed at controlling the use of firearms ? remains at the center of heated discussions among proponents and opponents of stricter gun laws.  To help understand the debate and its political and social implications, we addressed some key questions on the subject.  Is gun control effective? What gun control measures exist at the federal level? What are gun buyback programs and do they work? Where does the U.S. public stand on the issue? What do opponents of gun control argue? Why is it so hard to push for legislation? Throughout the world, mass shootings have frequently been met with a common response: Officials impose new restrictions on gun ownership. Mass shootings become rarer. Homicides and suicides tend to decrease, too. After a British gunman killed 16 people in 1987, the country banned semiautomatic weapons like the ones he had used. It did the same with most handguns after a school shooting in 1996. It now has one of the lowest gun-related death rates in the developed world. In Australia, a 1996 massacre prompted mandatory gun buybacks in which, by some estimates, as many as one million firearms were then melted into slag. The rate of mass shootings plummeted. Only the United States, whose rate and severity of mass shootings is without parallel outside conflict zones, has so consistently refused to respond to those events with tightened gun laws. Several theories to explain the number of shootings in the United States ? like its unusually violent societal, class and racial divides, or its shortcomings in providing mental health care ? have been debunked by research. But one variable remains: the astronomical number of guns in the country. America¡¯s gun homicide rate was 33 per one million people in 2009, far exceeding the average among developed countries. In Canada and Britain, it was 5 per million and 0.7 per million, respectively, which also corresponds with differences in gun ownership. Americans sometimes see this as an expression of its deeper problems with crime, a notion ingrained, in part, by a series of films portraying urban gang violence in the early 1990s. But the United States is not actually more prone to crime than other developed countries, according to a landmark 1999 study by Franklin E. Zimring and Gordon Hawkins of the University of California, Berkeley. Rather, they found, in data that has since been repeatedly confirmed, that American crime is simply more lethal. A New Yorker is just as likely to be robbed as a Londoner, for instance, but the New Yorker is 54 times more likely to be killed in the process. They concluded that the discrepancy, like so many other anomalies of American violence, came down to guns. More gun ownership corresponds with more gun murders across virtually every axis: among developed countries, among American states, among American towns and cities and when controlling for crime rates. And gun control legislation tends to reduce gun murders, according to a recent analysis of 130 studies from 10 countries. This suggests that the guns themselves cause the violence. ? Max Fisher and Josh Keller, Why Does the U.S. Have So Many Mass Shootings? Research Is Clear: Guns. Every mass shooting is, in some sense, a fringe event, driven by one-off factors like the ideology or personal circumstances of the assailant. The risk is impossible to fully erase. Still, the record is confirmed by reams of studies that have analyzed the effects of policies like Britain¡¯s and Australia¡¯s: When countries tighten gun control laws, it leads to fewer guns in private citizens¡¯ hands, which leads to less gun violence. Much of current federal gun control legislation is a baseline, governing who can buy, sell and use certain classes of firearms, with states left free to enact additional restrictions. Dealers must be licensed, and run background checks to ensure their buyers are not ¡°prohibited persons,¡± including felons or people with a history of domestic violence ? though private sellers at gun shows or online marketplaces are not required to run background checks. Federal law also highly restricts the sale of certain firearms, such as fully automatic rifles. The most recent federal legislation, a bipartisan effort passed last year after a gunman killed 19 children and two teachers at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, expanded background checks for buyers under 21 and closed what is known as the boyfriend loophole. It also strengthened existing bans on gun trafficking and straw purchasing. ? Aishvarya Kavi Gun buyback programs are short-term initiatives that provide incentives, such as money or gift cards, to convince people to surrender firearms to law enforcement, typically with no questions asked. These events are often held by governments or private groups at police stations, houses of worship and community centers. Guns that are collected are either destroyed or stored. Most programs strive to take guns off the streets, provide a safe place for firearm disposal and stir cultural changes in a community, according to Gun by Gun, a nonprofit dedicated to preventing gun violence. The first formal gun buyback program was held in Baltimore in 1974 after three police officers were shot and killed, according to the authors of the book ¡°Why We Are Losing the War on Gun Violence in the United States.¡± The initiative collected more than 13,000 firearms, but failed to reduce gun violence in the city. Hundreds of other buyback programs have since unfolded across the United States. In 1999, President Bill Clinton announced the nation¡¯s first federal gun buyback program. The $15 million program provided grants of up to $500,000 to police departments to buy and destroy firearms. Two years later, the Senate defeated efforts to extend financing for the program after the Bush administration called for it to end. Despite the popularity of gun buyback programs among certain anti-violence and anti-gun advocates, there is little data to suggest that they work. A study by the National Bureau of Economic Research, a private nonprofit, found that buyback programs adopted in U.S. cities were ineffective in deterring gun crime, firearm-related homicides or firearm-related suicides.  . Evidence showed that cities set the sale price of a firearm too low to considerably reduce the supply of weapons; most who participated in such initiatives came from low-crime areas and firearms that were typically collected were either older or not in good working order. Dr. Brendan Campbell, a pediatric surgeon at Connecticut Children¡¯s Medical Center and an author of one chapter in ¡°Why We Are Losing the War on Gun Violence in the United States,¡± said that buyback programs should collect significantly more firearms than they currently do in order to be more effective. Dr. Campbell said they should also offer higher prices for handguns and assault rifles. ¡°Those are the ones that are most likely to be used in crime,¡± and by people attempting suicide, he said. ¡°If you just give $100 for whatever gun, that¡¯s when you¡¯ll end up with all these old, rusted guns that are a low risk of causing harm in the community.¡± Mandatory buyback programs have been enacted elsewhere around the world. After a mass shooting in 1996, Australia put in place a nationwide buyback program, collecting somewhere between one in five and one in three privately held guns. The initiative mostly targeted semiautomatic rifles and many shotguns that, under new laws, were no longer permitted. New Zealand banned military-style semiautomatic weapons, assault rifles and some gun parts and began its own large-scale buyback program in 2019, after a terrorist attack on mosques in Christchurch. The authorities said that more than 56,000 prohibited firearms had been collected from about 32,000 people through the initiative. Expanded background checks for guns purchased routinely receive more than 80 or 90 percent support in polling. Nationally, a majority of Americans have supported stricter gun laws for decades. A Gallup poll conducted in June found that 55 percent of participants were in favor of a ban on the manufacture, possession and sale of semiautomatic guns. A majority of respondents also supported other measures, including raising the legal age at which people can purchase certain firearms, and enacting a 30-day waiting period for gun sales. But the jumps in demand for gun control that occur after mass shootings also tend to revert to the partisan mean as time passes. Gallup poll data shows that the percentage of participants who supported stricter gun laws receded to 57 percent in October from 66 percent in June, which was just weeks after mass shootings in Uvalde, Texas, and Buffalo. A PDK poll conducted after the shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde found that 72 percent of Republicans supported arming teachers, in contrast with 24 percent of Democrats. Opponents of gun control, including most Republican members of Congress, argue that proposals to limit access to firearms infringe on the right of citizens to bear arms enshrined in the Second Amendment to the Constitution. And they contend that mass shootings are not the result of easily accessible guns, but of criminals and mentally ill people bent on waging violence. ? Annie Karni Polling suggests that Americans broadly support gun control measures, yet legislation is often stymied in Washington, and Republicans rarely seem to pay a political price for their opposition. The calculation behind Republicans¡¯ steadfast stonewalling of any new gun regulations ? even in the face of the kind unthinkable massacres like in Uvalde, Texas ? is a fairly simple one for Senator Kevin Cramer of North Dakota. Asked what the reaction would be from voters back home if he were to support any significant form of gun control, the first-term Republican had a straightforward answer: ¡°Most would probably throw me out of office,¡± he said. His response helps explain why Republicans have resisted proposals such as the one for universal background checks for gun buyers, despite remarkably broad support from the public for such plans ? support that can reach up to 90 percent nationwide in some cases. Republicans like Mr. Cramer understand that they would receive little political reward for joining the push for laws to limit access to guns, including assault-style weapons. But they know for certain that they would be pounded ? and most likely left facing a primary opponent who could cost them their job ? for voting for gun safety laws or even voicing support for them. Most Republicans in the Senate represent deeply conservative states where gun ownership is treated as a sacred privilege enshrined in the Constitution, a privilege not to be infringed upon no matter how much blood is spilled in classrooms and school hallways around the country. Though the National Rifle Association has recently been diminished by scandal and financial turmoil, Democrats say that the organization still has a strong hold on Republicans through its financial contributions and support, hardening the party¡¯s resistance to any new gun laws. ? Carl Hulse, ¡°Why Republicans Won¡¯t Budge on Guns.¡± Yet while the power of the gun lobby, the outsize influence of rural states in the Senate and single-voter issues offer some explanation, there is another possibility: voters. When voters in four Democratic-leaning states got the opportunity to enact expanded gun or ammunition background checks into law, the overwhelming support suggested by national surveys was nowhere to be found. For Democrats, the story is both unsettling and familiar. Progressives have long been emboldened by national survey results that show overwhelming support for their policy priorities, only to find they don¡¯t necessarily translate to Washington legislation and to popularity on Election Day or beyond. President Biden¡¯s major policy initiatives are popular, for example, yet voters say he has not accomplished much and his approval ratings have sunk into the low 40s.The apparent progressive political majority in the polls might just be illusory. Public support for new gun restrictions tends to rise in the wake of mass shootings. There is already evidence that public support for stricter gun laws has surged again in the aftermath of the killings in Buffalo and Uvalde, Texas. While the public¡¯s support for new restrictions tends to subside thereafter, these shootings or another could still produce a lasting shift in public opinion. But the poor results for background checks suggest that public opinion may not be the unequivocal ally of gun control that the polling makes it seem. ? Nate Cohn, ¡°Voters Say They Want Gun Control.

And in each place we hear the same message: Do something. For God¡¯s sake, please do something. We did something afterwards, but not nearly enough. We still need to ban, in my view, AR-15 firearms and assault weapons. How many more parents will live their worst nightmare before we stand up to the gun lobby, to establish universal background checks, establish a national red flag laws, require safe storage of firearms and end immunity from liability for gun manufacturers? It¡¯s time to act. It¡¯s time to make our voices heard. Not as Democrats or as Republicans, but as friends, as neighbors, as parents, as fellow Americans. And I¡¯m being deadly earnest when I say that. By Peter Baker Reporting from Washington President Biden, in a somber speech evoking the pain of the death of two of his own children, implored Congress on Wednesday to ¡°please do something¡± to stop the flow of guns involved in mass shootings like the school massacre that killed 19 children and two teachers a year ago in Uvalde, Texas. Marking the anniversary of the killings, Mr. Biden called again for tighter laws on firearms, including a ban on assault weapons like the one used by the killer in Uvalde. But he implicitly acknowledged that the chances of passing such gun laws anytime soon were slim, and he offered no new ideas for how to overcome entrenched opposition. ¡°How many more parents will live their worst nightmare before we stand up to the gun lobby?¡± the president asked during a brief speech at the White House, flanked by the first lady, Jill Biden, and standing in front of 21 burning candles honoring the victims. ¡°It¡¯s time to act, it¡¯s time to act,¡± he added. ¡°It¡¯s time to make our voices heard, not as Democrats or as Republicans but as friends, as neighbors?as parents, as fellow Americans.¡± In a nod to the political reality of a Congress heavily influenced by gun rights activists and to the frustrations of many families of those killed, he said: ¡°I know for a long time it¡¯s been hard to make progress. But there will come a point when our voices are so loud, our determination so clear, that we can no longer be stopped. We will act.¡± Mr. Biden¡¯s statement came a year after a gunman burst into Robb Elementary School in the small Texas town of Uvalde and opened fire on a fourth-grade class in one of the deadliest such campus attacks in American history. More than 370 police officers responded but failed to confront the gunman for 77 minutes. School and police officials later lost their jobs and the school district dismantled its police force altogether. The school building is set to be demolished. But the slaughter did little to move lawmakers at the state or national level. While a Texas legislative committee advanced a bill raising the age to buy an AR-15-style rifle to 21 from 18, the bill never got a vote on the House floor. The state also stopped defending in court a higher age requirement for carrying a handgun, effectively lowering the age for that to 18 from 21. Congress passed legislation with modest changes, enhancing background checks for gun buyers under 21, increasing funds for mental health crisis intervention, bolstering laws against straw purchases and encouraging states to enact red-flag laws authorizing the government to temporarily take guns away from anyone deemed likely to pose a danger to themselves or others. Mr. Biden signed those measures into law. In his statement on Wednesday, Mr. Biden said that legislation did not go far enough and again called on Congress to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, impose universal background checks, require safe storage of firearms, pass a national red-flag law and eliminate immunity from liability for the gun industry. The National Rifle Association has resisted such laws, calling them part of a larger campaign by leftist politicians to undermine the Second Amendment and ultimately take guns away from law-abiding citizens. ¡°Gun-hating politicians, media, and activists label law-abiding Americans as crazy if we even begin suggest their end goal is confiscation,¡± the group wrote on Twitter this week, citing a White House post on that platform advocating an assault weapon ban. ¡°They scream, ¡®No one is coming for your guns!¡¯ However, today¡¯s White House tweet advocating for widespread gun bans contradicts this.¡± During his speech at the White House, Mr. Biden addressed the loved ones of those killed in Uvalde in personal terms. ¡°To the families of the children and educators, we know one year later it¡¯s still so raw for you,¡± Mr. Biden said. ¡°A year of missed birthdays and holidays, school plays, soccer games, just that smile. A year of everyday joy is gone forever. The bend of his smile, the perfect pitch of her laugh.¡± He made clear he was speaking from experience, later alluding to his traumas as a parent who lost his first wife and 1-year-old daughter in a car accident in 1972 and then his grown son Beau Biden to cancer in 2015. ¡°While everyone¡¯s pain is different, we like many of you have some understanding of what it¡¯s like to lose a child ? on more than one occasion,¡± he said. ¡°For those who¡¯ve lost a loved one in Uvalde, to the moms and dads, the brothers, the sisters, the grandmoms, the grandpops, this is what I know,¡± he said. ¡°They¡¯ll never be gone from your heart, they¡¯ll always be part of you.¡± Peter Baker is the chief White House correspondent and has covered the last five presidents for The Times and The Washington Post.

Rejects Pleas to Act","President Biden said he had reached the limit of his powers to act alone on gun violence, and needed Congress to respond. Republicans said they had already done all they were willing to do. By Annie Karni WASHINGTON ? The mass shooting at a Christian elementary school in Nashville this week has generated a broad shrugging of the shoulders in Washington, from President Biden to Republicans in Congress, who seemed to agree on little other than that there was nothing left for them to do to counter the continuing toll of gun violence across the country. But while President Biden¡¯s stark admission on Tuesday that he could do no more on his own to tackle the issue was a statement of fact that aimed to put the burden on Congress to send him legislation, like the ban on assault weapons he has repeatedly championed, Republicans¡¯ expressions of helplessness reflected an unwillingness, rather than an inability, to act. Their answer to Mr. Biden¡¯s plea was as blunt as it was swift, as lawmaker after Republican lawmaker made it clear that they had no intention of considering any additional gun safety measures. ¡°We¡¯re not going to fix it,¡± Representative Tim Burchett, Republican of Tennessee, told reporters on the steps of the Capitol just hours after the shooting that killed three children and three adults in his home state. ¡°Criminals are going to be criminals.¡± Mr. Burchett said he saw no ¡°real role¡± for Congress to play in reducing gun violence, and volunteered that his solution to the issue of protecting his family was to home-school his children. Likewise, Senator Mike Rounds, Republican of South Dakota, said Congress had done enough. ¡°When we start talking about bans or challenging the Second Amendment, the things that have already been done have gone about as far as we¡¯re going with gun control,¡± Mr. Rounds told CNN.  Last year, Congress passed a narrow, bipartisan compromise that enhanced background checks to give authorities time to examine the juvenile and mental health records of any prospective gun buyer under the age of 21, and a provision that for the first time extended a prohibition on domestic abusers having guns to dating partners. The bill was the first major gun control legislation that Congress had passed in decades, but it addressed only a small set of issues designed to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people. At the time, Republicans like Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader, noted that supporting the measure was necessary to win back suburban voters, who broadly support some changes to the nation¡¯s gun laws. But even then, proponents conceded that the bill did not signify a political shift on gun restrictions; rather, it was a measure that went precisely as far as Republicans were willing to go in strengthening gun laws, and one pushed through only by a fleeting political coalition that would soon dissipate. Several of those Republican supporters have since retired, and the House is now in the hands of G.O.P. leaders who have no intention of allowing gun safety legislation to reach the floor. ¡°Gun violence is uniquely an American problem because of lawmakers who refuse to act proactively to prevent it,¡± said Christian Heyne, the vice president for policy at the Brady: United Against Gun Violence organization, who noted that House Republicans this week had originally scheduled a committee vote to weaken the government¡¯s authority to keep short-barreled rifles off the streets. ¡°Our lawmakers should be working to strengthen our gun laws, not weaken them,¡± he said. But even the Republicans who championed the law enacted last summer showed no desire to take any further action. Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, who served as the lead Republican negotiator on that bill, dismissed Mr. Biden¡¯s calls for banning assault weapons as a set of ¡°tired talking points.¡± ¡°I want to see the bill we just passed get implemented,¡± he said. One of the provisions of that bill provided funding for states to enact so-called red-flag laws that allow authorities to temporarily confiscate guns from people deemed to be dangerous. But Tennessee does not have a red flag law, and would not benefit from federal funds to implement a law that Republican state lawmakers are not willing to consider. ¡°I don¡¯t think there¡¯s any appetite,¡± Senator Cynthia Lummis, Republican of Wyoming, said flatly of her party¡¯s willingness to take on gun control legislation. Ms. Lummis voted against the bipartisan measure that Congress passed last summer, along with all but 15 of her G.O.P. colleagues. The intransigence of Republicans on the issue of guns was deeply frustrating, if not surprising, to Democrats, who pointed out that polls show that a vast majority of voters support some toughening of the nation¡¯s laws, such as adding universal background checks. ¡°We¡¯ve got too many politicians in this town who work for the gun lobby,¡± said Senator Raphael Warnock, Democrat of Georgia. ¡°The people need some public servants who actually work for them.¡± Mr. Warnock said he had been on a flight to Washington sitting next to a Republican colleague when the news of the Nashville shooting interrupted their conversation, and that they had reflected on the ¡°human toll¡± of the tragedy. ¡°I¡¯m still hoping against hope that somehow my colleagues will find enough courage to put the survival of five-year-olds and nine-year-olds ahead of their perceived political advantage,¡± Mr. Warnock added. Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, who has often encouraged his colleagues to take a decades-long view of progress on the issue of guns, vented on Twitter about Republicans like House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who refused to answer any questions about the shooting. ¡°Why seek leadership if you aren¡¯t willing to lead?¡± Mr. Murphy tweeted. ¡°Burying your head in the sand and hoping the carnage stops isn¡¯t going to work.¡± At the same time, some Republicans who did speak out tried to turn away from any discussion of guns by seeking a different culprit for the tragedy. After the mass shooting last year at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, where 19 children and two teachers were killed, Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, said that the issue was one of a security failure, and that the answer was for armed agents to be stationed at schools. In this case, many right-wing Republicans, who have made opposition to transgender health care and rights a focus of their social agenda, sought to shift the focus by seizing on an assertion by law enforcement authorities that the assailant in Nashville had been transgender. Senator J.D. Vance, Republican of Ohio, said on Twitter that the tragedy suggested that ¡°giving into these ideas¡± about accepting transgender individuals was ¡°dangerous.¡± After Karine Jeane-Pierre, the White House press secretary, criticized congressional Republicans for their inaction on guns, Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, pointedly made reference to the issue of the shooter¡¯s gender on Twitter, posting a message that, ¡°it doesn¡¯t get much lower than blaming Republicans in Congress for a transgender killer who targeted a Christian school.¡± In a statement, the Human Rights Campaign said that while all the facts of the shooting were not yet known, ¡°we do know that every study available shows that transgender and nonbinary people are much more likely to be the victims of violence, rather than the perpetrator of it.¡± Even as Republicans made it clear there was no avenue to passing more gun safety legislation, the Senate Chaplain, Barry Black, made an unusually urgent plea for action, praying aloud to ¡°deliver our senators from the paralysis of analysis that waits for the miraculous.¡± ¡°When babies die at a church school, it is time for us to move beyond thoughts and prayers,¡± the chaplain said in his opening prayer on Tuesday. ¡°Remind our lawmakers of the words of Edmund Burke: ¡®All that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good people to do nothing.¡¯¡± Luke Broadwater contributed reporting.

https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/15/us/politics/ghost-guns-biden.html?searchResultPosition=27,2022-12-15,New Federal Rule Has Done Little to Stem Spread of ¡®Ghost Guns¡¯,"Sellers of key components of the untraceable homemade firearms have been interpreting the rule in the narrowest possible way. By Glenn Thrush WASHINGTON ? President Biden celebrated the adoption of a federal rule in August that cracked down on the online sale of untraceable components for weapons known as ghost guns as a major step in stemming gun violence. But the rule has done little to stop the sale of key parts used to make deadly homemade firearms, according to officials and gun control groups. The rule, among the most significant executive actions Mr. Biden has taken on a core campaign promise, clarified the definition of a firearm under federal law to better regulate modern semiautomatic weapons. That in turn paved the way for regulating ready-made kits, which include all the parts needed to assemble a workable firearm in under an hour. The move was a centerpiece of the administration¡¯s broader initiative to address the proliferation of illegal weapons driving an increase in mass shootings and violent crime ? an effort highlighted by the passage of Mr. Biden¡¯s sweeping, if limited, bipartisan gun deal in June. But because the rule was created through executive action, rather than a statute validated by Congress, it has given companies confidence that they can keep selling individual gun parts. Dozens of online retailers are still selling core components used to make ghost guns, also known as privately manufactured firearms, according to research by Everytown for Gun Safety, an advocacy group founded by Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City. Many have adopted the narrowest possible interpretation of the rule, continuing to sell so-called 80 percent frames and receivers, which require simple alterations to become operational. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the agency responsible for enforcing gun laws, has been reluctant to target vendors who sell those parts out of concern that doing so would prompt a legal backlash ? even though Mr. Biden¡¯s allies are pushing the administration to take a much more aggressive stance. ¡°The problem is it¡¯s a regulation, not a statute, so there¡¯s only so much A.T.F. can do,¡± said Adam Winkler, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, who studies the legal and constitutional issues around gun policy. ¡°There are clear limits, and they risk losing in court if they push it too far,¡± he added. ¡°That¡¯s why you now see companies that used to market the kits simply switching over to selling the components separately, and letting the buyers assemble their own kits.¡± In recent months, gun control groups and Democrats in Congress have pressured Steven M. Dettelbach, the A.T.F.¡¯s new director, to act more decisively. In October, Senators Richard Blumenthal and Christopher S. Murphy, Democrats of Connecticut, along with 12 other senators, wrote Mr. Dettelbach asking for a detailed update on enforcement of the new law. Gun safety groups have enlisted Democratic legislators to nudge Mr. Dettelbach in weekly phone calls. But A.T.F. officials have cautioned that pushing the limits of the rule with a range of other changes, like requiring federally licensed firearms dealers to place serial numbers on homemade guns bought from do-it-yourself sellers, could jeopardize it entirely. The rule also compels gun dealers to improve their record-keeping procedures. Many gun control groups believe the A.T.F. is being too cautious, citing the first wave of mostly unsuccessful court challenges to the regulation as proof that an expanded crackdown could be legally viable. ¡°The sale of ghost guns is finally illegal, but you wouldn¡¯t know it for all the companies still selling untraceable firearms to anyone with a credit card and a desire to avoid a background check,¡± said John Feinblatt, the president of Everytown. ¡°President Biden issued a muscular regulation to stop the sale of ghost guns, but now it¡¯s time for D.O.J. and A.T.F. to use the strength he gave them to keep Americans safe,¡± he added. The bureau, in consultation with senior leaders at the Justice Department, is hashing out a circular to clarify what the new rule means for the sale of components used to produce Glock-style pistols, the weapon of choice for many criminals seeking an untraceable firearm. The guidance is expected to be made public before the end of the year. A similar letter governing AR-15-type rifles, which represent a much smaller percentage of homemade firearms used in crimes, was released in September. It did not signal significant new restrictions on the sale of components, to the frustration of gun safety groups. But the A.T.F. seems likely to continue its deliberate approach ? analyzing court decisions for clues on how hard they can push, and monitoring online vendors whose marketing materials may run afoul of a new rule that requires kits to be given serial numbers like over-the-counter firearms, according to officials. It is not clear if the new guidelines on handguns will target the sale of online parts. But A.T.F. officials have told members of Congress they worry that doing so would almost certainly elicit court challenges from gun rights groups arguing that such action violates the Gun Control Act of 1968, which allows the construction of firearms for their personal use without submitting to background checks or applying serial numbers. ¡°The Constitution does not authorize the federal government to prevent you from making your own firearm,¡± Representative Thomas Massie, Republican of Kentucky, said on Twitter shortly before the rule was announced in April. ¡°This a fact that has been recognized for 200+ years.¡± But A.T.F. officials are increasingly confronting challenges posed by rapidly evolving technologies that regulators have not had to confront in the past, such as 3-D printing of gun parts and the online marketing and sale of weapons on social media. Ghost guns, which have gone from a novelty to a national menace in the past several years, are emblematic of those challenges. They are increasingly becoming the lethal weapon of easy access for those legally barred from buying or owning guns around the country, especially in states with stringent gun control laws. In 2021, the Justice Department reported that law enforcement agencies had recovered 19,300 homemade guns, about five times the number confiscated or found at crime scenes in 2018. The problem has reached epidemic proportions in California, according to local and federal law enforcement officials in Los Angeles, Oakland, San Diego and San Francisco. Over the past several years, the officials said, ghost guns accounted for 25 to 50 percent of firearms recovered at crime scenes. The vast majority of suspects caught with them were legally prohibited from having guns. The struggle to translate Mr. Biden¡¯s emphatic declarations on ghost guns has fallen to Mr. Dettelbach, the first permanent A.T.F. director confirmed by the Senate in nearly a decade. During his first several months in office, he has quietly reorganized the bureau¡¯s senior leadership, and sought to bolster morale among career staff. Mr. Dettelbach, a former U.S. attorney in Ohio, has also prioritized investigations into so-called straw purchase rings organized to buy weapons that are later sold to criminals and federally licensed gun dealers who violate the law. Many liberal-leaning states and localities have passed their own laws to regulate ghost guns after a series of mass shootings involving them. At least 10 states have done so and a handful of cities, including New York, Washington and Los Angeles, have sued ghost gun manufacturers over attacks carried out using such weapons. But the powerful gun lobby strongly opposed the new federal rule, and several conservative legal groups have already challenged it, arguing that it violates existing firearms laws and Second Amendment protections. In August, 17 states and a coalition of gun rights activists sued the Biden administration in federal court in North Dakota. That suit was rejected, but other challenges, including a lawsuit in a federal court in Texas, remain unresolved after a judge issued a temporary restraining order against the rule¡¯s implementation.

By Maggie Astor The massacre at a Walmart in Chesapeake, Va., is the second high-profile shooting in less than two weeks in the state, long a center of the national battle over gun policy. Nine days before the attack on Tuesday, in which at least six people were killed, three students at the University of Virginia were fatally shot on Nov. 13. Virginia, the longtime home of the National Rifle Association, has historically been dominated by conservatives who favored more permissive gun laws. But after Democrats took full control of the state government in 2019, they passed a significant package of changes. Policies they passed in 2020 included universal background checks, reporting requirements for lost or stolen firearms, a limit of one handgun purchase per month for most people, and a red-flag law that allows authorities to seize guns from people who pose an immediate threat to themselves or others. In 2021, the legislature passed another set of measures, including a three-year ban on firearm possession for some people convicted of assaulting a family member. Research shows it is common for mass shooters to have a history of domestic abuse, especially against women. Even so, Virginia ? site of one of the country¡¯s worst mass shootings, the 2007 rampage at Virginia Tech ? remains permissive in some ways. For example, it allows the open carrying of handguns without a permit, with some exceptions. Everytown for Gun Safety, a prominent gun control advocacy group, ranks Virginia 14th in the country for the strength of its gun laws. Democrats lost control of the governorship and the House of Delegates a year ago, and Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, has said he would support repealing some of the Democratic-led policies if his party were to regain control of the State Senate. Asked on Wednesday whether the recent shootings had influenced the policies he would support, Mr. Youngkin¡¯s office referred to comments he made at an appearance in Richmond that morning. In those comments, he acknowledged the two attacks in quick succession and said that both investigations were still in progress. ¡°When the facts come in at the end of all the investigations, then we¡¯ll have time to come together and talk about what actions we can take,¡± he said.

By Mitch Smith and Ernesto Londo?o LANSING, Mich. ? Democrats in Michigan pressed ahead with a torrent of liberal measures on Wednesday, the boldest assertion yet of their new political power since taking full control of state government this year for the first time in four decades. In the course of a single afternoon and evening, and despite loud objections from many Republicans, the Michigan House of Representatives voted to repeal a right-to-work law loathed by labor unions, expand background checks for gun purchases and enshrine civil rights protections for L.G.B.T.Q. people in state law. On the other side of the Capitol, the State Senate voted to repeal an abortion ban that is unenforceable but still on the books. Some of the legislation must still be voted on in the other chamber, and all of it would have to be signed by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, to take effect. The rapid-fire votes were possible only because Michigan Democrats narrowly won a trifecta ? control of both legislative chambers and the governor¡¯s office ? in last year¡¯s election after spending much of the prior decade on the lawmaking sidelines. Republicans swept into power in Michigan in the 2010s and quickly remade the state in their image, just as they did in Indiana, Ohio, Wisconsin and beyond. By 2018, Republicans had full control of 26 statehouses. But Democrats have steadily rebuilt their state-level strength in the last few years, with full control now in 17 capitals ? their most since 2009 and up from only six in 2017. Republicans control 22 states, including Nebraska, where the unicameral Legislature is officially nonpartisan.  In Minnesota, one of four states where Democrats have a new trifecta this year, lawmakers have already codified abortion rights, set ambitious clean energy goals, allowed undocumented immigrants to obtain driver¡¯s licenses and restored the voting rights of an estimated 55,000 former prisoners. To press their agenda, Democrats have used some of the same act-fast tactics honed by Republicans when they came into power. But it remains unclear how far Democrats will be able to go. Though buoyed by budget surpluses and, at least so far, minimal intraparty dissent, Democrats in Minnesota and Michigan are constrained by slim majorities and legislative sessions that are rapidly ticking away. ¡°I didn¡¯t realize how valuable the time we have here is,¡± Joe Tate, the speaker of the Michigan House, said in an interview just after his chamber approved an expansion of the state civil rights law and hours before it was scheduled to take up bills on unions and guns. ¡°There¡¯s only a finite amount of time for us to get things done,¡± he said. Not that long ago, the Michigan Capitol was a laboratory of conservative policymaking. In 2012, with Republicans holding full control of state government, legislators passed a right-to-work law that allowed employees in unionized workplaces to opt out of paying union dues or their equivalent. The law has helped the state, said former officials who supported it back then. ¡°All the fallout and all the problems that were predicted by some of the labor leaders did not happen,¡± said Randy Richardville, a Republican who served as majority leader in the Senate when the bill passed. ¡°It was a good thing for the workers of Michigan to decide whether they wanted to join a union or not, whether it gave them benefits or not.¡± But that law, passed amid chaotic protests, infuriated Democrats and union leaders in a state that had historically been a center of the labor movement. Lisa Canada, a longtime union official in Michigan, said the law gradually eroded the clout of organized labor as contracts expired and had to be renegotiated. Still, organized labor remained a political force in the state. Though the percentage of Michigan workers in unions has declined to about 14 percent from about 17 percent since 2012, it remains above the national average. ¡°You¡¯ve got this climate where companies that you might have been negotiating with for decades now see unions as weaker,¡± said Ms. Canada, who until recently served as the political director of the Michigan Regional Council of Carpenters and Millwrights. ¡°So they go into negotiations with a whole different attitude.¡± When Democrats came to power this year, they quickly pledged to undo right-to-work. And on Wednesday, workers in union apparel testified in support of the repeal and filled the balcony of the House chamber as Democrats invoked their two-seat majority to do what they said was the will of the people. ¡°Back in November, voters sent a clear message when they elected a pro-worker and pro-working families majority,¡± Representative Regina Weiss, a Democrat, said when presenting the right-to-work repeal to a committee. But Jase Bolger, a Republican who served as speaker of the Michigan House from 2011 to 2014, predicted Democrats would pay a price if they completed the repeal of right-to-work, which he credited with helping boost the state¡¯s economy a decade ago. The repeal must still clear the State Senate. ¡°I think they¡¯re going to damage Michigan¡¯s economy and therefore hurt Michigan¡¯s families,¡± Mr. Bolger said. ¡°I think that¡¯s what¡¯s going to cause the political fallout that they¡¯re not seeing yet.¡± But in both Michigan and Minnesota, Democrats say they are merely doing what they were elected to do. Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, who signed an executive order on Wednesday to protect access to medical care for transgender people, said Democrats with new trifectas had moved swiftly to expand rights and make good on campaign promises. ¡°This isn¡¯t about saving political capital and trying to figure out how long you get to stay,¡± Mr. Walz said in a recent interview. ¡°If we¡¯re doing these things, and we¡¯re representing the people, they will vote accordingly.¡± And even as Michigan Democrats advanced bills on some of the country¡¯s most contentious topics ? abortion, guns, L.G.B.T.Q. rights ? Mr. Tate, the House speaker, said they were addressing widely known, long-held priorities. ¡°There¡¯s certainly no secrets or surprises for what we want to do,¡± he said. ¡°So we want to make sure that it¡¯s getting done. And getting done in a timely manner.¡± Mitch Smith reported from Lansing, Mich., and Ernesto Londo?o from St. Paul, Minn. Mitch Smith covers the Midwest and the Great Plains.

Gov. John Fetterman beat Mehmet Oz after a tumultuous campaign in Pennsylvania, yet control of Congress remained uncertain. Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York held off her Republican challenger. Follow our live coverage of the remaining results in the 2022 midterm elections.   Jonathan Weisman A hard-fought victory by Pennsylvania¡¯s lieutenant governor, John Fetterman, over the celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz flipped a Senate seat from Republican to Democrat, the latest sign that the so-called red wave that Republicans expected on Tuesday simply was not materializing. Both parties racked up high-profile victories in governors¡¯ races and Senate contests, but after one of the most consequential midterm campaigns in recent history, control of the House and Senate remained uncertain in the early hours of Wednesday.  So far, only one Democratic incumbent, Representative Elaine Luria of Virginia, had been defeated in the fight for the House. But one veteran Republican, Representative Steve Chabot, also lost in Ohio.  And in other critical House races, endangered Democrats like Representatives Abigail Spanberger of Virginia and Chris Pappas of New Hampshire retained their seats, according to The Associated Press. Seth Magaziner won in deep-blue Rhode Island to keep an open seat in the Democrats¡¯ column and chill Republicans¡¯ pre-election boasts of a looming blowout. Voters were determining which party would control not only the House and the Senate but also 36 governorships and an array of critical state positions, like secretaries of state and supreme court justices. Their choices will influence the rest of the Biden presidency, the future of legal abortion in several states, and even the shape of representative democracy itself. But as election results flowed in, it became clear that the midterms of 2022 had jolted Republican expectations and surprised even the Democrats. Fears of a collapse in Democratic states proved unfounded as governors¡¯ contests in New York and Pennsylvania, a House race in Rhode Island and Senate races in Colorado and Washington all went to the Democrats. And in swing states, Democrats fared far better than expected. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, was re-elected in Michigan, as was Gov. Tony Evers in Wisconsin. Democrats were holding other seats in the upper Midwest, such as Representative Angie Craig¡¯s Minnesota House seat, that they had feared losing. They were outperforming expectations in South Texas, winning two of three contested House seats.  Only in Florida and New York were Republicans actually making early gains. Early Wednesday in New York, Republicans held one seat on Long Island and took an open seat there from the Democrats.   In the contest for the Senate, Maggie Hassan, a Democrat from New Hampshire, and Michael Bennet, the Democratic senator from Colorado, won re-election decisively, according to The Associated Press, ending two races that were seen as potential harbingers for a Republican blowout. But in Ohio, the author and investor J.D. Vance defeated his Democratic challenger, Representative Tim Ryan, by seven percentage points, about the same margin by which Donald J. Trump defeated Joseph R. Biden Jr. two years ago. Here is what you need to know: In Georgia, Stacey Abrams, once a rising star in the Democratic Party, conceded to Gov. Brian Kemp, ending a bitter, high-profile rematch of their 2018 contest. The Associated Press has not yet called the race. In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis flipped Miami-Dade County, which had not voted for a Republican candidate for governor in two decades, in a resounding victory, potentially setting up a clash for his party¡¯s 2024 presidential nomination with Mr. Trump. And Senator Marco Rubio defeated his Democratic challenger, Representative Val Demings, securing his third term in Congress and further cementing the G.O.P.¡¯s grip on the state.  Trailblazers made early marks in governor¡¯s races, with Maryland electing its first Black governor, Wes Moore, a Democrat; Massachusetts electing its first female governor, Maura Healey, who will also be the nation¡¯s first openly lesbian governor; and Arkansas making Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a former White House press secretary under Mr. Trump, the state¡¯s first female to hold the position. There¡¯s no better place for you to watch the results come in than nytimes.com. Here¡¯s how we call the winners. And here¡¯s where we get the very latest results from across the country. Our needle to help you understand which candidate or party is on track for victory is explained here. It may take days to get a clear picture of the results. Here is a rundown of the likely timeline.    Stuart A. Thompson Los Angeles County dropped criminal charges against the top executive of an elections technology company on Wednesday, bringing to an abrupt end an unusual case that became the focus of Americans who distrust the country¡¯s electoral system. The district attorney¡¯s office said in a statement that it had dropped the case against the executive, Eugene Yu, because of concerns about the ¡°pace of the investigation¡± and the ¡°potential bias in the presentation¡± of evidence in the case. The office said the county had assembled a new team to ¡°determine whether any criminal activity occurred.¡± The prosecutors did not respond to questions about the decision. ¡°Mr. Yu is an innocent man,¡± Gary Lincenberg, Mr. Yu¡¯s lawyer, said in a statement, adding that ¡°conspiracy theorists¡± were using the arrest to ¡°further their political agenda.¡± Last month, Los Angeles prosecutors accused Mr. Yu, the chief executive of Konnech, a small election software company in Michigan, of storing data about poll workers on servers in China, a breach of the company¡¯s contract with the county. The charges related only to poll worker data and had no impact on votes or election results. Mr. Yu, 64, has repeatedly denied sending data to China. The New York Times published an article about the claims and his denials as a part of its coverage of misinformation and elections. Los Angeles prosecutors arrested Mr. Yu the day after the article was published. The abrupt dismissal left several unanswered questions about the case and Mr. Yu¡¯s suspected activities. The district attorney¡¯s office did not clarify whether the company had, in fact, stored data in China. It was also not clear whether additional criminal or civil charges could be filed against Mr. Yu or Konnech from Los Angeles County or dozens of other counties that use Konnech¡¯s election management software. Konnech has about 20 employees in the United States and about 20 customers. It plays no role in the tabulation or counting of votes in American elections. But some election deniers have suggested that Konnech gave the Chinese government a back door to manipulate America¡¯s election process. True the Vote, an organization that claims to be devoted to uncovering election fraud, said at a conference this summer that its team had found and downloaded Konnech¡¯s poll worker data from servers in China. It provided no evidence that it had downloaded the data, but said it had delivered a hard drive to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Konnech sued True the Vote, along with Catherine Engelbrecht, its founder, and Gregg Phillips, an election denier and longtime associate of the group, accusing them of defamation and hacking. The pair were briefly jailed last week after refusing to release the name of a person involved in the suspected hack of Konnech¡¯s data. In an earlier court filing, Mr. Phillips said he had spoken with the grand jury in Los Angeles County that eventually indicted Mr. Yu.  Michael Wines WASHINGTON ? Republican candidates swept elections for state supreme courts in North Carolina and Ohio on Tuesday, victories that could prove pivotal in future disputes over state legislative and congressional maps in both states. But in a string of state judicial contests marked by partisan attacks and heavy spending by outsiders, Democratic candidates prevailed in races in Illinois and appeared poised to win two seats in Michigan. And nonpartisan judicial candidates in Kentucky and Montana withstood advertising barrages by a right-wing group and an arm of the national Republican Party to win their races by comfortable margins. In Kansas, term extensions for six Supreme Court justices were comfortably approved by voters in retention elections. Opposition to two of the six, who had voted with the majority in a 2019 ruling that abortion was a right protected by the State Constitution, failed to materialize. After years at the bottom of most ballots, races for major state courts are increasingly attracting political attention and national money as federal courts hand control of partisan issues like abortion, gun rights and voting rights to state legislatures and judges. In Ohio, Illinois, North Carolina and Michigan, where court candidates ran under party labels, results of court races largely tracked the state parties¡¯ overall successes. But attack ads by conservative groups appeared to have little impact on races where judicial candidates were nonpartisan, said Douglas Keith, a state court expert and counsel to the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center for Justice. ¡°Perhaps those voters were more resistant to the overtly political and partisan campaign tactics in those races,¡± he said. The Republican election sweeps in Ohio and North Carolina almost certainly will quickly impact political maps in both states. In Ohio, a 4-to-3 majority of justices has repeatedly rejected maps drawn by a G.O.P.-dominated redistricting commission as unconstitutional gerrymanders. Federal court rulings reinstated those maps for this year¡¯s elections, but under the State Constitution, new maps must be drawn for races in 2024. Chief Justice Maureen O¡¯Connor, a Republican who provided the crucial vote for the majority that struck down the maps, retires at year¡¯s end. Her Republican replacement will decide whether to reverse course and uphold the new maps, which will be drawn by the same Republican-run commission. The Democratic majority on the North Carolina Supreme Court also voted 4-to-3 to reject maps drawn by the Republican legislature, but replacement maps drawn by a court expert are a stopgap, and the legislature will draw another set of maps for the 2024 election. The court¡¯s new Republican majority is widely expected to reject any effort to throw out those maps, regardless of their partisan balance. In the nonpartisan Kentucky races, voters rejected two Supreme Court candidates backed by outside conservative groups, including a Republican state representative who ran overtly as a Republican. Notably, they also re-elected a circuit court judge in the state capital, Frankfort, who had been a longtime target of Republicans because of his rulings in the many state government cases that came before his court. That judge, Phillip Shepherd, drew a barrage of attack ads from Fair Courts America, and his opponent, Joe Bilby, is a former aide to Senate Minority leader Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican, and drew support from Mr. McConnell¡¯s political action committee. In Montana, an incumbent justice, Ingrid Gustafson, easily defeated the state Republican Party¡¯s favored candidate, James Brown, who also drew support from the Republican State Leadership Committee.  Mitch Smith and Ava Sasani Voters in all five states where abortion-related questions were on the ballot this week chose to secure access to the procedure or reject further limits. The results, which came just months after the U.S. Supreme Court removed the constitutional right to abortion, showed that when asked directly, a broad cross section of Americans want to protect abortion rights. Residents of California, Michigan and Vermont decided to enshrine abortion protections in their state constitutions, according to The Associated Press, while voters in Kentucky ? where abortion is currently banned ? rejected an amendment that would have said there was no right to the procedure at the state level. In Montana, The Associated Press said on Thursday, voters rejected a ballot initiative that would have required medical interventions to save infants of any gestational age defined by the state as ¡°born alive.¡± Abortion-rights groups opposed that measure, with some doctors saying that they were concerned that it would limit palliative care for infants who were born but would not survive. Voters supported abortion rights in several states and elected governors friendly to access in some of the most competitive races. Other states may see more restrictions. Abortion also appeared to shape results in some candidate races. Across the country, Democratic politicians emphasized their support for legal abortion on the campaign trail, while many Republicans opposed to abortion tried to focus voters on other issues. The amendments marked a victory for abortion rights supporters, who since losing in the Supreme Court this summer have sought to preserve or restore access to the procedure through a series of lawsuits, ballot initiatives and legislative fights. Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, a Democrat who won re-election on Tuesday, said it was ¡°a point of pride¡± that abortion was now protected in the State Constitution. ¡°It¡¯s a point of principle and it¡¯s a point of contrast,¡± he said, ¡°at a time of such mixed results all across this country.¡± Abortion-rights supporters have increasingly looked to ballot questions as a way to advance their interests, even in Republican-leaning places. In August, in the first major political test of abortion after Roe v. Wade fell, Kansas voters overwhelmingly rejected a constitutional amendment that would have ended abortion protections at the state level. That result in a conservative-leaning state was seen by national Democrats as a sign of the issue¡¯s political potency and an opening for their candidates in November. But as the Supreme Court decision began to fade from the headlines, Republicans who support abortion restrictions tried to shift the political conversation to more favorable ground like economic issues and crime. In Michigan, the vote on whether to place abortion protections in the State Constitution played out at the same time as a high-stakes governor race. Gretchen Whitmer, the Democratic incumbent, made support for abortion rights central to her campaign. She won re-election, The Associated Press said. The Michigan amendment is likely to have the most immediate impact. A state law that was dormant for decades while Roe was in effect bans abortion, but enforcement of that measure had been temporarily blocked by the courts. Lisa Baldwin-Ryan, 58, voted in favor of the amendment despite her complex views on abortion. ¡°I am totally against people who use it as a form of birth control, but not everybody is strong enough to carry a child if they¡¯re a victim of rape and incest ? therefore, why should they be forced?¡± said Ms. Baldwin-Ryan, who supported the Libertarian candidate for governor. Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life, which opposes abortion rights, said early Wednesday that Michigan voters would experience ¡°buyer¡¯s remorse¡± after passing the amendment. In Kentucky, a reliably Republican state that is among many in the South with abortion bans, the vote on whether to amend the Constitution to say it contained no right to abortion came just a week before the State Supreme Court was scheduled to hear a challenge to Kentucky¡¯s abortion ban. The amendment, pushed by anti-abortion groups, was seen as a way to insulate that ban from judicial review. JoAnn Lewis, 63, of Lexington, Ky., said she favored the amendment. ¡°Life, once it is seeded, it needs to grow just like a garden ? you¡¯ve got to protect it,¡± Ms. Lewis said at a polling place. But Samia Temsah-Deniskin, 38, said she voted against the amendment ¡°because women should choose what happens with their bodies.¡± Ms. Temsah-Deniskin, a photographer from Paris, Ky., said that she was pregnant and also has a daughter, and that ¡°these rights are so important for women in particular.¡± The decision was cheered by abortion rights groups in Kentucky, even as they warned that the fate of access was still tied up in the courts. ¡°This is a victory for bodily autonomy and the right of all Kentuckians to make the best decisions for themselves, but the fight is not over,¡± said Amber Duke, the interim executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky. California and Vermont already had robust abortion protections in law. The votes on Tuesday provided the states with more durable bulwarks against any future anti-abortion legislation, but did little to change the immediate situation. With nearly all ballots counted, about 77 percent of Vermont voters favored the amendment. In California, Sherman Jones, 54, said he considered the Supreme Court¡¯s abortion ruling an affront to a woman¡¯s right to privacy. ¡°I just think that¡¯s something that individuals and their doctors need to decide and not politicians,¡± said Mr. Jones, who lives in Riverside County and voted to add abortion protections to the California Constitution. Reporting was contributed by Sarah Baird, Corinne Boyer, Jill Cowan, Ryan Patrick Hooper, Shawn Hubler and Amy Schoenfeld Walker.  Rick Rojas Voters in Maryland and Missouri approved ballot measures on Tuesday to legalize recreational marijuana, according to The Associated Press, adding those states to a list that has swelled in recent years. But similar efforts were also shot down in Arkansas, North Dakota and South Dakota ? a mixed result that underscored the varying public attitudes over marijuana use. Those measures were among the many initiatives that appeared on ballots across the country on Tuesday ? an exercise in direct democracy that has offered an unfiltered glimpse into voters¡¯ stances on some of the most pressing and polarizing issues, including voting rights, gun restrictions and abortion access. The results according to The Associated Press have, in many ways, reflected the deep fissures running through the country. Measures related to voting were under consideration in several states, with some pursuing restrictions meant to bolster election security and others pushing to expand and protect access amid fears of a concerted campaign to weaken the country¡¯s election systems. Many of these measures could be traced to former President Donald J. Trump¡¯s efforts to overturn his loss and mobilize his supporters by spreading baseless claims of a stolen election. Voters in Ohio approved an initiative aimed at thwarting any attempt to allow people who are not U.S. citizens from voting in local elections. The proposal was meant to counter efforts elsewhere, including in New York City, to allow permanent legal residents and people authorized to work in the United States to vote in city-level races. A similar proposal is up for a vote in Louisiana on a Dec. 10 ballot. In Nebraska, roughly two-thirds of voters supported a measure to require photo identification to vote. Voters in Michigan supported adding measures to the state constitution, including opening polls for early voting, meant to make it easier to cast ballots.  In Connecticut, a measure to allow in-person early voting was passed. Arkansas voters rejected an initiative that would have raised the threshold for passing a ballot measure or constitutional amendment to a three-fifths supermajority from a simple majority. In Iowa, voters, by a wide margin, supported an initiative?enshrining gun rights in an amendment?to the State Constitution that declares that residents¡¯ ability ¡°to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.¡± Voters in Tennessee, Oregon and Vermont supported ballot measures that remove language allowing slavery as punishment from their state constitutions. And in Alabama, more than three-quarters of voters endorsed changes to the State Constitution that removed outdated and racist language, including language related to slavery. But in Louisiana, a related initiative had a more complicated outcome, with nearly two-thirds of voters rejecting a measure that was originally intended to remove language from the State Constitution allowing slavery as punishment. The initial sponsor of the referendum had condemned the proposal and urged voters to defeat it, telling The Advocate newspaper in Baton Rouge that the measure¡¯s wording had changed so much in the legislative process that it could be interpreted to say it was allowing what it purported to take out. These measures to forbid slavery or involuntary servitude as punishment have gained traction across the country in recent years, creating an opening for prisoners to challenge the practice of forced labor for which they are paid pennies per hour or nothing at all.  Ava Sasani Voters in Michigan voted in favor of abortion rights, The Associated Press said, amending their State Constitution to create a right to reproductive freedom, including decisions ¡°about all matters relating to pregnancy,¡± such as abortion and contraception.  Nate Cohn While Republicans remain modest favorites in the House, it could be days or even longer until there¡¯s enough information to be sure whether Republicans gained control of the chamber. Republicans are still 22 seats away, and many of the seats they need are in slow-counting western states.  Maggie Astor Representative Elissa Slotkin, a moderate Democrat, was re-elected in the Seventh District of Michigan, according to The Associated Press, defying the district's tilt toward Republicans. The Republican candidate, Tom Barrett, had sought to cast her as a progressive in centrist¡¯s clothes.  J. David Goodman HOUSTON ? The familiar contours of Texas politics held firm for another election despite a concerted effort and many millions in campaign spending aimed at proving otherwise. As the votes came in on Tuesday, Democrats remained locked out of statewide offices ? from the governor¡¯s mansion to the agriculture commissioner¡¯s office ? and Republicans could point to some gains among Hispanic voters, winning an open congressional seat in South Texas, though fewer than they had hoped for. The election did not feature dramatic shifts in either direction. ¡°The RED WAVE did not happen,¡± said Representative Mayra Flores, a Republican who gained fame within the party by winning a special election in a Democratic district in the Rio Grande Valley this year only to lose on Tuesday. Beto O¡¯Rourke, the Democratic challenger to Gov. Greg Abbott, failed to attract enough new supporters to improve upon his performance in the U.S. Senate race in 2018, earning for himself a second statewide loss and renewed questions about his political future. The surge of enthusiasm that lifted up Texas Democrats in 2018, creating a wave for many candidates at the local level, did not resurface. At the same time, the party avoided a complete wipeout in South Texas as incumbents in Congress ? Representatives Henry Cuellar and Vicente Gonzalez ? each won their races despite tough contests. (Mr. Gonzalez defeated Ms. Flores.) Republicans managed to win back some voters in the suburbs, blunting what had seemed in recent elections to be promising inroads made by Democrats in these diversifying and fast-growing areas, particularly north of Dallas and Fort Worth. Instead, those counties appeared to remain solidly in the Republican column, with Mr. Abbott carrying Collin and Denton Counties by wide margins. Tarrant County, which includes the city of Fort Worth and which Mr. O¡¯Rourke narrowly won in 2018, also went for Mr. Abbott this time. For the most part, Texas¡¯ cities remained strongly Democratic, including the election to Congress of Greg Casar, a rising progressive star in a deeply blue district that includes Austin. But an open question remained in Harris County, which includes Houston, where Republicans and conservatives spent heavily to unseat the Democratic county leader, Lina Hidalgo, another young and promising party leader. The race was too close to call as of early Wednesday, and it was unclear whether the result would be affected by a legal fight over provisional ballots cast when polls stayed open an hour late, under a district court order, to make up for delays in opening at several locations. That order was blocked by the Texas Supreme Court, and the late-cast provisional ballots were segregated from the total. The conservative sweep of statewide offices included Ken Paxton, the Trump-endorsed and criminally-indicted attorney general of the state, who was re-elected to a third term, and Dan Patrick, the hard-right lieutenant governor, who had drawn some opposition from his own party over his leadership of the State Senate, but not enough to make a difference in his re-election. The victories appeared likely to result in a new round of conservative proposals when the Republican-dominated State Legislature meets next year. Among the topics discussed during the campaign were school vouchers, lowering the age for Texans to carry a handgun and a reduction in the burden of property taxes. Mr. Abbott has so far signaled resistance to adding exceptions to the state¡¯s abortion ban for rape and incest.  Emily Cochrane As Democrats and Republicans wrestled for control of the House and the Senate, both parties flipped crucial seats, keeping the majority up for grabs into the wee hours of Wednesday morning, with several races still too close to call, according to The Associated Press. Democrats made the first Senate pickup as they fought to defend their majority, with the victory of Lt. Gov. John Fetterman over Mehmet Oz, a Republican, in Pennsylvania. Mr. Fetterman will succeed Senator Pat Toomey, a Republican, who is retiring. House Republicans had defeated a single Democratic incumbent, Representative Elaine Luria of Virginia, a Democrat who serves on the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 riot and lost to Jen. A Kiggans, a Republican state senator. Ms. Luria faced a more conservative electorate after redistricting, a dynamic that also helped deliver two open Florida seats currently held by Democrats to House Republicans. The G.O.P. won an Orlando-area seat left open by the retirement of Representative Stephanie Murphy and a Gulf Coast seat left open after Representative Charlie Christ¡¯s unsuccessful bid for governor. By early Wednesday morning, Democrats had also defeated one incumbent Republican. Representative Steve Chabot of Ohio lost his Cincinnati-area seat to Greg Landsman, a Democrat and a Cincinnati City Council member. In Michigan, Hillary Scholten, a Democrat, defeated Republican John Gibbs, a former Trump administration housing official. Mr. Gibbs had ousted Representative Peter Meijer, a centrist Republican who voted to impeach former President Donald J. Trump, in a tough primary where Democrats intentionally poured money to elevate Mr. Gibbs, a candidate they viewed as easier to defeat. In Texas, Representative Vicente Gonzalez, a Democrat who represents a neighboring district, won in the 34th Congressional District, defeating Mayra Flores, a Republican who flipped the seat for her party in a June special election. Democrats also claimed an open seat in North Carolina being vacated by Ted Budd, a Republican, who won election to the Senate. Wiley Nickel, a Democrat and two-term state senator, defeated Bo Hines, a Republican 27-year-old political novice and onetime football phenomenon. Results of competitive Senate races in five states ? Georgia, Nevada, Arizona, Alaska and Wisconsin ? remained outstanding early Wednesday.  Michael C. Bender and Maggie Haberman Donald J. Trump wasn¡¯t on the ballot Tuesday, but he¡¯d spent the past two years behaving otherwise, aiming to deliver key victories to a Republican Party from which he¡¯s likely to seek, once again, a presidential nomination. Several battleground races remained too close to call early Wednesday, but it was clear there would be no ¡°giant red wave¡± that Mr. Trump had spent weeks pleading with his supporters to deliver. In some key states, Trump-backed candidates lost or were faring poorly. In Pennsylvania, the Democrat Josh Shapiro won the governor¡¯s race against the Republican Doug Mastriano, while the Democrat John Fetterman defeated Mehmet Oz, a Republican, to flip control of a U.S. Senate seat. In Michigan, Tudor Dixon, Mr. Trump¡¯s pick in the governor¡¯s race, came up short in her bid to unseat Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. In Arizona, where Kari Lake and Blake Masters had campaigned together as ¡°America First¡± candidates in Mr. Trump¡¯s mold, both were behind in their races for governor and Senate, respectively, although results were too close to call. Some of Mr. Trump¡¯s candidates fared well, such as J.D. Vance, the Republican Senate nominee in Ohio. And the candidate in whom Mr. Trump was most personally invested, the former football player Herschel Walker, whose Senate candidacy in Georgia has been rocked by allegations that he had encouraged women to have abortions that he paid for, appeared poised to force a runoff. One of the party¡¯s biggest victories of the night came in Florida, where Gov. Ron DeSantis won re-election with margins that Republicans hadn¡¯t seen there in two decades. Unlike four years ago, when Mr. Trump¡¯s endorsement helped lift Mr. DeSantis¡¯s underdog campaign, the governor didn¡¯t seek the former president¡¯s help for re-election. Mr. DeSantis was the target of a derisive nickname from Mr. Trump in the final days of the race. Mr. Trump targeted Mr. DeSantis in part because the governor is widely viewed as the leading alternative to the former president for the Republican nomination. Mr. DeSantis hasn¡¯t said whether he would run for the White House, but Mr. Trump ? who is expected to announce his third consecutive presidential bid next week ? has told reporters that he viewed Mr. DeSantis as a competitor. The close races on the rest of the electoral map confounded Mr. Trump. At an election-night party at his Mar-a-Lago resort, he was not particularly interested in addressing the crowd, according to a person familiar with the events. He did deliver brief remarks, and one of the few people he praised was Katie Britt, the Republican Senate candidate from Alabama whose victory was seen as a foregone conclusion. He made no mention of Mr. DeSantis¡¯s win, focusing instead on the wide victory for Senator Marco Rubio, who did campaign with Mr. Trump. To demonstrate his continuing influence on the party, Mr. Trump endorsed roughly 300 candidates during the 2022 midterm contests, a sharp departure from more than a century of U.S. political tradition. Not since 1908, when Teddy Roosevelt second-guessed his anointing of William Howard Taft as his Republican successor, had a former president been so active in party politics. Republicans acknowledged that the night had been underwhelming. ¡°Definitely not a Republican wave, that¡¯s for darn sure,¡± Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and a close ally of Mr. Trump, told NBC News. The intense focus on the midterms for Mr. Trump has stemmed almost entirely from his quest for redemption following his loss in the 2020 presidential election and from his desire to keep the party loyal to him. Since 2016, when Mr. Trump shocked the Republican establishment with a thoroughly dominating takeover of the G.O.P., his political style has resulted in more collateral damage for fellow conservatives than electoral success. He was the first president in decades to lose the House, the Senate and the White House within four years. With a different president in office this time, Republicans sensed an opportunity to make up for some of those losses. But for Mr. Trump, it was a moment to tighten his grip on the party. ¡°If this proves to be another Senate flop in a year that was otherwise favorable to Republicans ? even if not a wave ? it will again be a function of the candidates they put up, which was unmistakably shaped and steered by Donald Trump,¡± said Liam Donovan, a former aide to the National Republican Senatorial Committee. Mr. Donovan noted the possibility of a runoff in the Georgia contest, where Mr. Trump could still demonstrate his pull if Mr. Walker defeats Senator Raphael Warnock, the Democratic incumbent. Mr. Trump¡¯s singular pursuit of maintaining his political brand ? more than defeating Democrats ? has been threaded through all his endorsements and his decision, for the first time, to spend a significant amount of money to help elect other candidates. His super PAC, MAGA Inc., spent more than $16 million on television advertising in the final month in six states, about 9 percent of all Republican spending in the same ra",NYT

By Zolan Kanno-Youngs and Michael Corkery Zolan Kanno-Youngs reported from Washington and Michael Corkery from West Hartford, Conn. President Biden made a forceful case on Friday for stronger gun laws, saying American children caught up in school shootings are suffering from the same trauma as soldiers in war. Speaking at a firearms safety summit in West Hartford, Conn., attended by victims of gun violence, Mr. Biden marked one year since the passage of a bipartisan bill intended to prevent dangerous people from accessing guns. But he said there was more to be done. ¡°What¡¯s the difference between the post-traumatic stress that a soldier meets in the hills of Afghanistan,¡± Mr. Biden asked, and the kind of trauma?a ¡°fourth-grade kid meets in a classroom when they have to duck and cover?¡± Mr. Biden¡¯s call for action comes at a time of deep pessimism about the prospects for significant legislative action on gun control, despite one mass shooting after another in the United States. Even with majorities in both houses of Congress during Mr. Biden¡¯s first two years in office, Democrats could not pass a ban on assault weapons. Any effort now is almost certain to fail in the Republican-controlled House, as the party has largely united against new gun control measures. But Mr. Biden said on Friday that Congress must find a way to tighten the laws. ¡°If this Congress refuses to act,¡± Mr. Biden said,?¡°we need a new Congress.¡± One year ago, a bipartisan group of lawmakers struck a narrow compromise, galvanized by a mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, that killed 19 children and two teachers. The bill expanded background checks for gun buyers and set aside millions of dollars so states can pay for intervention programs, such as mental health and drug courts, and carry out red flag laws that allow authorities to temporarily confiscate guns from any person found by a judge to be too dangerous to possess them. Mr. Biden said Friday?that the Justice Department has provided more than $230 million for states to expand such laws, and the Department of Health and Human Services has also provided more than $1.5 billion to states to hire 14,000 mental health professionals for schools. Mr. Biden said the legislation already was having an effect on violent crime in America, but he called it merely a ¡°first step.¡± The nonpartisan Council on Criminal Justice examined trends in 35 cities and found that homicides, gun assaults and reports of domestic violence declined slightly in 2022 compared with the year before. The Gun Violence Archive, a nonprofit research group that tracks gun violence using police reports, news coverage and other public sources, has counted more than 260 mass shootings as of late May. Last year, the group counted 647 mass shootings, which it defines as incidents in which at least four people were killed or injured. ¡°I don¡¯t know how many times I¡¯ve met with people at events in the country who shake my hand and say, ¡®I¡¯m worried there has been another shooting not far from where I live. I¡¯m scared to send my kid to school,¡¯¡± Mr. Biden said. ¡°It¡¯s had a profound impact.¡± Peter Ambler, the executive director of Giffords, the gun control organization founded by former Representative Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona, said gun control is a potent issue as the 2024 campaign heats up. ¡°I think the White House realizes how important this issue is to the American public and he¡¯s drawing a contrast between who has delivered results on this issue, Joe Biden and the Democrats, and who has not,¡± Mr. Ambler said. Mr. Biden said in March that he had ¡°gone the full extent of my executive authority to do, on my own, anything about guns,¡± and added that the burden to act was on Congress.?Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, left open this week the possibility that the White House could take additional action, but did not provide details. ¡°We¡¯re always going to figure out what else we can do to protect communities,¡± Ms. Jean-Pierre said. ¡°So that is something that we¡¯re ? that certainly our team is going to look at.¡± An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misidentified the location of the event.

https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/21/us/politics/guns-airport-security.html?searchResultPosition=33,2022-09-21,Guns Found at Airport Checkpoints Are On Track to Break Record,"This year, Transportation Security Administration officers have already discovered more than 4,600 guns at airport security checkpoints, and about 87 percent of them were loaded. By Mark Walker WASHINGTON ? The Transportation Security Administration is on pace this year to again break the record for the number of guns intercepted at airport security checkpoints, underscoring a persistent challenge for security officials amid brisk gun sales in the United States. So far this year, T.S.A. officers have already discovered more than 4,600 guns at airport checkpoints, and about 87 percent of them were loaded, according to the agency. Last year, the T.S.A. found nearly 6,000 guns at airport checkpoints, which itself was a record. The number of guns discovered at security checkpoints has been trending upward for more than a decade, with the only decrease coming during the pandemic. The slew of guns found at the nation¡¯s airports this year have come as air travel in the United States is nearing a return to prepandemic levels. Gun sales in the country have surged in recent years, suggesting that some travelers may be unfamiliar with the rules for carrying firearms while traveling by plane. ¡°Entering a checkpoint with a firearm, particularly a loaded one, is an expensive mistake,¡± said Carter Langston, a T.S.A. spokesman. When a gun is found at a checkpoint, the T.S.A. does not seize it. Instead, agents are instructed to call law enforcement to handle the situation. There is no federal criminal penalty for passengers caught with a gun at a checkpoint, but the T.S.A. can impose a fine of up to about $14,000 and the loss of PreCheck membership ? which allows for expedited security screening ? for up to five years. Potential criminal charges, if any, vary by state. In Texas, law enforcement officials often tell travelers to get out of line, lock their guns in their cars and return to try to catch their flights. In New York, however, the discovery of a gun at a checkpoint will most likely end with the passenger in handcuffs. The severity of any criminal charges can also differ based on whether the person has a permit to carry a concealed weapon. In Florida, for example, someone with a concealed-carry permit stopped at an airport checkpoint can be charged with a second-degree misdemeanor. A passenger without one could face a felony for carrying a concealed weapon. Guns were discovered at 268 of the country¡¯s airports last year, according to the T.S.A., and the 10 airports with the largest number of them were all in the South or the West. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport led the nation with 507 guns found. Last year, a gun was accidentally discharged at a checkpoint at the Atlanta airport, causing a panic among travelers. And this spring, Representative Madison Cawthorn, Republican of North Carolina, was briefly detained by the police after trying to bring a loaded gun through airport security in Charlotte ? the second time in a little over a year that he had been found with a gun at an airport checkpoint. While guns cannot be brought onto planes in carry-on baggage, they are allowed to be transported in checked baggage. Those firearms must be unloaded and locked in a hard-sided case. Aidan Johnston, the director of federal affairs for Gun Owners of America, a gun rights group, said that many passengers found with guns at airport checkpoints were in a stressed state because they were traveling and might not have been thinking about the location of their gun. He suggested that the increase in guns found at checkpoints could be driven in part by first-time gun owners who may not be familiar with the rules of traveling with a firearm. Mr. Johnston said he did not support states¡¯ punishing travelers for an honest mistake, but he encouraged gun owners to take on the responsibility of educating themselves about the T.S.A.¡¯s requirements. ¡°I think gun owners should go out and learn the rules for how to take a firearm from one place to another and how to take a firearm through an airport,¡± Mr. Johnston said. Shannon Watts, the founder of Moms Demand Action, a gun control group, said the rise in guns found at airports was ¡°the logical result of record gun sales and states weakening gun safety laws with extreme policies like permitless carry, which encourage guns anywhere, for anyone, no questions asked.¡± The T.S.A. has tried to do more to keep guns from getting past security checkpoints. In March, the agency announced that it was investing about $780 million in CT X-ray scanners that would help it better detect weapons, explosives and other objects by creating 3-D images of carry-on items. The issue has also come under scrutiny on Capitol Hill. At a hearing in February, Representative Bonnie Watson Coleman, Democrat of New Jersey, called for the T.S.A. to explore additional ways to deter travelers from bringing guns to airport security checkpoints. She said the increase in unruly passengers and the rise in guns at airports were a ¡°toxic combination.¡± Ms. Watson Coleman, the chairwoman of the House Homeland Security Committee¡¯s subcommittee on transportation security, has proposed legislation intended to address the uptick in guns found at checkpoints. Her bill would establish minimum fines for repeat or serious violations and require increased signage at airports to warn passengers against bringing firearms through security screening. In a statement, Ms. Watson Coleman cited the incident at the Atlanta airport last year and added, ¡°If nothing is done, it is only a matter of time until tragedy occurs and lives are lost.¡± Mark Walker is an investigative reporter in the Washington bureau.

https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/13/us/politics/justice-dept-firearm-accessories.html?searchResultPosition=34,2023-01-13,Justice Dept. Cracks Down on Firearm Accessories in Bid to Bolster Gun Safety,"A final rule will require gun owners to apply for a permit within 120 days to use the accessories known as stabilizing braces. By Glenn Thrush WASHINGTON ? The Biden administration said on Friday that it would crack down on the sale of firearm accessories used to convert short-barreled semiautomatic weapons into long rifles, part of a stepped-up effort to address mass shootings. A final rule released by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives will require about three million gun owners to apply for a permit within 120 days to use the accessories, known as stabilizing braces. After that, they will have to pay a $200 fee. New buyers of braces will have to pay the tax immediately. ¡°In the days of Al Capone, Congress said back then that short-barreled rifles and sawed-off shotguns should be subjected to greater legal requirements than most other guns,¡± the director of the A.T.F., Steven M. Dettelbach, said in announcing the rule alongside Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. ¡°The reason for that is that short-barreled rifles have the greater capability of long guns, yet are easier to conceal, like a pistol.¡± The rule comes on the heels of the government¡¯s decision to strictly enforce another federal regulation, this one intended to limit the availability of homemade, untraceable firearms known as ghost guns. Both measures, which rely on interpretations of existing federal law, are facing legal challenges from gun rights groups that claim they violate the constitutional right to bear arms.  Under federal law, possession of sawed-off shotguns and other short-barreled rifles ? favored by criminals because they combine easy concealment with lethal firepower ? is illegal. As its name indicates, a removable stabilizing brace allows assailants to leverage shorter-length weapons against their shoulder, providing a more stable platform for firing rapid bursts of deadly fire. Mr. Garland said the rule was intended to alert firearm manufacturers, dealers and individual gun owners that they ¡°cannot evade these important public safety protections simply by adding accessories to pistols that transform them into short-barreled rifles.¡± The rule will become effective over the next week after it is published in the Federal Register. A preliminary version was submitted earlier this year and officials said they made one substantial change ? eliminating a checklist to determine if the rule applied to a gun ? after receiving more than 230,000 comments from citizens, many of them gun owners opposed to the regulation. Officials with the National Rifle Association have criticized the new rule, saying it would adversely affect disabled veterans and other people who require braces to fire handguns. In late December, the Biden administration closed a major loophole in a new federal rule, finalized over the summer, to regulate ghost gun components. The A.T.F., under pressure from gun control activists, directed vendors who sell partly finished frames of Glock-style handguns ? the pistol grip and firing mechanism ? to treat them like fully completed firearms, which are subject to federal regulations. The guidance could severely restrict the sale of unregulated and untraceable ¡°80 percent¡± frames and receivers that have been linked to thousands of crimes, a top goal of the gun control movement. Such parts require only simple alterations to become operational. This month, an appeals court in New Orleans suspended implementation of another rule, proposed during the Trump administration, that blocks the sale of another accessory, ¡°bump stocks,¡± used by the man who killed 60 people in the mass shooting in 2017 in Las Vegas.

https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/29/us/nashville-gun-laws.html?searchResultPosition=35,2023-03-30,"After Mass Shootings, Republicans Expand Access to Guns","In states around the country, Republican lawmakers are pushing laws to expand the ability to own and carry firearms. By Mike Baker,?Serge F. Kovaleski and Glenn Thrush After a mass shooting at an elementary school in Texas last year prompted calls for new gun restrictions, Republican-led states around the country moved in the other direction. One of them was Tennessee, where the governor insisted that tighter firearms laws would never deter wrongdoers. ¡°We can¡¯t control what they do,¡± Gov. Bill Lee said. Tennessee lawmakers have instead moved to make firearms even more accessible, proposing bills this year to arm more teachers and allow college students to carry weapons on campus, among other measures. Then came the attack on Monday at the Covenant School in Nashville, where a shooter carrying multiple weapons killed six people, including three children. The same day, a federal judge signed off on a state settlement allowing people as young as 18 to carry a handgun without a permit. Amid the ghastly cadence of multiple mass shootings that have prompted calls for more comprehensive controls on guns, Republicans in statehouses have been steadily expanding access to guns. In Kentucky, Ohio, Nebraska, Texas and Virginia, Republicans have pushed this year to limit gun-free zones, remove background checks and roll back red-flag laws that seek to remove firearms from those who are a danger to themselves or others. Missouri last year enacted a measure that made it illegal for local law enforcement to cooperate with federal authorities in many gun investigations. A federal judge earlier this month struck down the law as unconstitutional. And in Florida on Thursday, the Legislature approved a bill allowing the carrying of concealed weapons in most places, without a permit. Gov. Ron DeSantis was expected to sign it. ¡°I think it¡¯s gotten progressively worse over the years,¡± North Carolina¡¯s Democratic governor, Roy Cooper, said in an interview. On Wednesday, the Republican-controlled Legislature in his state overrode his veto and eliminated a century-old pistol permitting system. In 25 states, no permits are required to carry a handgun ? nine more than in 2020. ¡°That has been the most rapid expansion of gun rights at the state level that we have seen,¡± said Jacob Charles, an associate professor who specializes in firearms law at the Pepperdine Caruso School of Law. Perhaps nowhere represents the shift to expand gun access more than Tennessee, a state at the crossroads of Appalachia, the upper South and lower Midwest whose politics on guns typify Red America¡¯s rapid movement rightward on gun regulations. In recent years, Republicans in the Tennessee State Legislature ? a 20-minute drive from the site of this week¡¯s mass shooting ? have passed a series of measures that have weakened regulations, eliminating some permit requirements and allowing most residents to carry loaded guns in public, open or concealed, without a permit, training or special background checks. The decisions came even after a representative of the Tennessee Sheriffs¡¯ Association rose at a legislative hearing to oppose the permitting measure, saying it would make knowing whether a person was unlawfully carrying a weapon more difficult for law enforcement. Jerry Sexton, then a Republican state representative, accused him of wanting ¡°to infringe upon the rights of us as a people.¡± ¡°I am offended by the fact that you are doing this,¡± Mr. Sexton said. ¡°I say that you need to back off and let citizens be citizens.¡± Republican leaders around the country have rushed to burnish their firearms credentials, mindful that even the suggestion they are not all-in on gun rights could have political consequences. A congressman in Georgia ran for the office in 2020 with yard signs featuring an AR-15 rifle. Former President Donald J. Trump made a point of appearing in person at the National Rifle Association convention in Houston in May, not long after the school shooting in Uvalde. Other candidates have repeatedly been using guns in television ads. Representative Andy Ogles, a Republican whose district includes the Covenant School where this week¡¯s mass shooting took place, posted a Christmas photo of his family posing with rifles in 2021. The photo drew criticism this week in the aftermath of the killings. ¡°Why would I regret a photograph with my family exercising my rights to bear arms?¡± he said. The National Rifle Association remains a potent force on the right despite a recent drop in fund-raising, amid questions about the lavish spending habits of its senior leadership in the Beltway. And the gun rights movement itself has become both more diffuse and influential, with local groups ? including the Gun Owners of America and the conservative Dorr brothers network in the Midwest ? gaining a following, and pressuring Republican state lawmakers from the right. In the Nashville killing, the parents of the shooter ? identified by police as Audrey E. Hale ? had reported that their child was under doctors¡¯ care and ¡°should not own weapons,¡± said Chief John Drake of the Nashville Metro Police Department. The shooter had purchased seven firearms from five local gun stores and then used three of them during the attack. The Republican initiatives have not been limited to statehouses. In Congress, the same day as the Tennessee shooting, the House Judiciary Committee chairman, Jim Jordan, an Ohio Republican, postponed a hearing where he planned to make the case for a Republican bill to outlaw one of the modest regulatory efforts undertaken by the Biden administration, a requirement to register so-called stabilizing braces that allow semiautomatic pistols to be propped against the shoulder for easier, more focused firing. Images of the weapons used in the Nashville shooting appeared to show that the killer owned such a brace and might have used it in the attack, according to law enforcement officials. It would not have been illegal to possess one ? owners of the braces have until the end of May to register their weapons and pay a $200 fee to comply with the change. ¡°Democrats were going to turn this tragic event into a political thing,¡± Mr. Jordan told reporters at the Capitol on Monday night. He said he had no plans to withdraw the measure or to slow his push to loosen gun laws. One of Tennessee¡¯s senators, Marsha Blackburn, made no mention of gun control ideas but called on Congress to find ways to increase security in schools. Gov. Lee vowed to ¡°act to prevent this from happening again¡± in Tennessee, but did not offer any specifics on how he planned to do so. A key committee in the state General Assembly decided to postpone the consideration of any bills relating to guns until next week, with State Senator Todd Gardenhire, a Chattanooga Republican, saying, ¡°We need to be respectful of those victims and the families of the victims.¡± Researchers examining the impact of mass shootings on gun policy found a few years ago that states with Republican-controlled legislatures were more likely to loosen gun laws in the year after a mass shooting in their state than in other years. States led by Democrats have long been pursuing more stringent gun control measures. In Connecticut after the school shooting in Newtown in 2012, state lawmakers expanded an assault weapons ban, banned high-capacity magazines and implemented universal background checks. Oregon voters last year approved a sweeping gun control measure, which requires gun purchasers to get a permit and take a gun safety course, that is currently being challenged in court. Other measures under consideration this year include efforts in Minnesota to make it easier to take guns from people deemed to be a threat, a plan in Oregon to ban untraceable guns that are assembled at home and a bill in Michigan to penalize those who leave guns in places accessible to children. State Representative Bo Mitchell, a Democrat from Nashville, has been outspoken about his opposition to various bills currently under review in the Tennessee Legislature that would expand access to firearms, hoping instead that lawmakers might respond to the recent mass shootings with measures such as expanded background checks and a ban on assault rifles. The state, he noted, has dealt with a series of mass shootings and soaring gun deaths among youths. ¡°If guns made us safer, Tennessee should be one of the safest states in the country,¡± he said. ¡°Instead, we have one of the worst gun violence problems in America.¡± Hundreds of people gathered in Public Square Park in downtown Nashville on Wednesday for a vigil honoring those killed during this week¡¯s shooting, cupping their hands around flickering white candles or shielding their eyes from the bright sun. They embraced one another and wiped away tears, some singing along as the musician Ketch Secor performed ¡°Will the Circle Be Unbroken?¡± The seven children of Mike Hill, a beloved custodian killed in the shooting, joined Jill Biden, the first lady, Mayor John Cooper, local leaders and law enforcement officials.

Now He¡¯s Heading to Congress.,"Maxwell Alejandro Frost, a Democrat who won a House race in Florida, will soon be the youngest member of Congress and its first denizen of Generation Z. By Blake Hounshell Don¡¯t let his tender age fool you: Maxwell Alejandro Frost has been doing this for a while. Frost was only 15 when the Sandy Hook shooting horrified him and inspired him to get involved in political activism; he flew to Connecticut as a high school kid to figure out how he could help. A decade later, as a not-so-grizzled veteran of various progressive causes, he will soon be the youngest member of Congress ? and its first denizen of Generation Z. Frost, who turns 26 in January, won his safely Democratic seat in Orlando after dispatching two former members of Congress, a state senator and a pastor in a fierce primary. And if he has stars in his eyes about filling the shoes of Representative Val Demings, a former police chief who made a futile run for Senate against Marco Rubio, he betrayed little of it in an interview last week. Frost said his freshman orientation was ¡°surreal¡± ? training sessions with the House Progressive Caucus and the A.F.L.-C.I.O., dinner at the Library of Congress, a midnight tour of the Capitol. But as the national organizing director for March for Our Lives, the Gen Z anti-gun-violence group, he is no stranger to Washington¡¯s corridors of power. ¡°I¡¯ve never been on the House floor,¡± Frost said. ¡°But I¡¯ve been in the office buildings, I¡¯ve been in the Capitol. I¡¯ve been coming up here pretty often since 2012, which is the Sandy Hook shooting. And I would come every year for the vigil for all victims of gun violence.¡± Frost has already hired a veteran Capitol Hill operator as his chief of staff and is putting together the rest of his team in Washington and back home in Orlando. Progressive leaders like Benjamin Jealous, the former N.A.A.C.P. president, and Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have embraced him as one of their own. But Frost is most eager to get to work on the issue that brought him to Washington: addressing gun violence. He wants Congress to invest in programs to engage young people in music or boxing ? anything to keep them out of trouble. Maybe, he thinks, he can find some bipartisan support for his ideas even while Democrats are in the minority in the House. ¡°What I learned in March for Our Lives is that when we invest in them, No. 1, they help end gun violence a lot quicker and it¡¯s more effective because it¡¯s community based,¡± he said, referring to young people. ¡°And on top of that, when law enforcement isn¡¯t involved at that early stage, you get your kids out of that school-to-prison pipeline.¡± He also learned how to think fast on his feet. When March for Our Lives became involved in lobbying Virginia state legislators to pass new gun safety laws, the group grew alarmed when it started getting death threats as protesters wielding assault rifles prepared to block entry to the Capitol in Richmond. Instead of holding a rally as planned, Frost and his fellow organizers found sympathetic lawmakers who let them sleep in their offices so that they were already inside the building the next morning. Since his election, Frost has been soliciting advice. Loads of it. From friends. From his new colleagues. From Demings, who advised him to stay focused on the people who elected him. ¡°As a leader of my community,¡± Frost said, he is constantly asking himself, ¡°¡®How am I going to build power for 2024 and for the future battles?¡¯¡± To do this, Frost went on, he wants to apply some of the lessons he learned as an activist ? what he calls ¡°bridging the gap between cool and consciousness.¡± March for Our Lives did this, he said, by using ¡°every tool in the toolbox.¡± Not just holding protests and registering young people to vote, but bringing in artists, cultural leaders and other influencers to make political engagement appealing to a younger crowd. It¡¯s the kind of trick that¡¯s easier to pull off when you¡¯re a 25-year-old jazz drummer and music obsessive than, say, Steny Hoyer. The 117th Congress that is just now wrapping up its term? It¡¯s the oldest in history. Nearly a quarter of its members are over 70. And while Democrats are planning to bring along new leadership, their likely next House leader, Representative Hakeem Jeffries, is 52 ? old enough to be Frost¡¯s father. Already, Frost is fielding questions about whether he intends to be just another backbencher, or whether he can serve as some kind of cultural ambassador. He¡¯s thinking about making ¡°a guide or something¡± to help Democrats communicate better with younger voters. And eventually, he wants to travel to other members¡¯ districts to make guest appearances at town hall events aimed at young people. Frost is thinking about not just his generation but also the next one. He wants to hold events for 13-year-olds who cannot yet vote but might someday form the backbone of the progressive movement. To do that, he argued, Democrats will need to break free from the defensive crouch in which they often find themselves. ¡°I think our party shouldn¡¯t be afraid of talking about bold, transformational change, things that maybe we won¡¯t get tomorrow,¡± Frost said. ¡°It¡¯s what we¡¯re fighting for. It¡¯s the world we believe in. Because I think especially young folks, they want something to vote for, not against.¡± The Supreme Court cleared the way for House Democrats to receive Donald Trump¡¯s tax returns, refusing his request to block their release in the final weeks of Democratic control of the chamber. Charlie Savage has the details. A federal appeals court panel signaled that it was likely to end a review of a trove of government documents seized this summer from Trump, a move that would greatly free up an investigation into his handling of the material, Charlie and Alan Feuer write. One of Trump¡¯s closest allies on Capitol Hill, Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, was forced to testify before a Georgia special grand jury that is investigating election interference by Trump and his advisers. Fifteen states, most of them led by Republicans, are going to court to try to keep in place a pandemic-related policy that allows the government to swiftly expel migrants arriving from Mexico, Miriam Jordan reports.

The court provisionally allowed the regulation while a challenge moves forward. By Adam Liptak Reporting from Washington The Supreme Court on Tuesday temporarily revived the Biden administration¡¯s regulation of ¡°ghost guns¡± ? kits that can be bought online and assembled into untraceable homemade firearms. In defending the rule, a key part of President Biden¡¯s broader effort to address gun violence, administration officials said such weapons had soared in popularity in recent years, particularly among criminals barred from buying ordinary guns. The court¡¯s brief order gave no reasons, which is typical when the justices act on emergency applications. The order was provisional, leaving the regulation in place while a challenge moves forward in the courts. The vote was 5 to 4, with Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Amy Coney Barrett joining the court¡¯s three liberal members ? Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson ? to form a majority. Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr., Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh noted dissents. Like the justices in the majority, they did not explain their reasoning. The regulation, issued in 2022 by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, broadened the bureau¡¯s interpretation of the definition of ¡°firearm¡± in the Gun Control Act of 1968. The change, Solicitor General Elizabeth B. Prelogar wrote in the Biden administration¡¯s emergency application, was needed to respond to ¡°the urgent public safety and law enforcement crisis posed by the exponential rise of untraceable firearms.¡± The new regulation did not ban the sale or possession of kits and components that can be assembled to make guns, she wrote, but it did require manufacturers and sellers to obtain licenses, mark their products with serial numbers and conduct background checks. Gun owners, advocacy groups and companies that make or distribute the kits and components sued to challenge the regulations, saying that they were not authorized by the 1968 law. That law defined firearms to include weapons that ¡°may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive¡± and ¡°the frame or receiver of any such weapon.¡± transcript [GUN CLICKS] This is a gun I made myself. The government doesn¡¯t know I have it, but it¡¯s totally legal. You can buy a kit online with all the parts you need to build a Glock 19. You don¡¯t need a 3-D printer or fancy tools, and you don¡¯t need a background check. I purchased the Glock 19 during Glocktober, so I got $100 off. People call these ghost guns. And they¡¯re becoming more popular, especially for people who want a gun, but don¡¯t want any record that it exists. I¡¯d like to see how easy it is to build one of these guns and to find out what these kits mean for the future of gun regulation. Order is confirmed. All that¡¯s left to do is build it. I don¡¯t have a handgun license in New York, so I sent the kit to Virginia, where you don¡¯t need one. Let¡¯s make a gun. I get the appeal of making a gun. I like building stuff. And for a lot of people who buy these kits, that¡¯s the point. They¡¯re fun to make. ¡°Hey, guys. Today we¡¯re going to be going over how to build your Full Conceal Polymer80 frame. So it¡¯s actually fairly quick to do this.¡± ¡°Kind of paint by numbers in a sense.¡± The lower receiver or frame is the only part of the gun that¡¯s technically considered a firearm under U.S. law. Gun kits aren¡¯t regulated like firearms because they come with unfinished lower receivers. ¡°So this is the lower receiver, and it¡¯s in this jig. So what we¡¯ll need to do is remove the extra pieces that are sticking up out of the jig.¡± [SNAPPING] Yeah, instead of shop, I took early childhood development. It was actually really awesome. The finished lower receiver looks almost identical to the unfinished one. You just drill a few holes and remove these extra bits of polymer. Then you assemble and add the rest of the parts. If you do it right, you¡¯ll have a working firearm. On a factory-made gun, the serial number would go here. But the gun I¡¯m building won¡¯t have one, so there¡¯s no way to trace it. Gun kits aren¡¯t regulated at all in most states. There are no records of sales. And for a lot of people, that¡¯s the appeal. ¡°Hey.¡± ¡°Hey.¡± ¡°Andy Lander.¡± ¡°Jeremy White.¡± Andy Lander is a firearms expert who worked for the N.R.A. for 13 years. He¡¯s built guns before. ¡°We¡¯re still technically a free country. And I think that one of the greatest freedoms is having privacy. To me, if you bought 100 guns, it¡¯s none of my business.¡± It¡¯s impossible to say how many ghost guns are out there or who owns them. Last year, nearly a third of all firearms seized by law enforcement in California were homemade without serial numbers. Still, Andy says the kits aren¡¯t the problem. ¡°A criminal is going to steal a gun. He¡¯s going to either rob somebody and get a gun. He¡¯s going to get a gun anyway. I¡¯m not worried about a guy building a Glock 19 in his garage.¡± ¡°Nope. Drop it in from the top.¡± ¡°Drop it in.¡± ¡°Straight down.¡± ¡°Oh, it has to be all the way ?¡± ¡°You have to clear that, yeah. Push down till it pops. Yeah, that¡¯s it.¡± [GUN CLICKS] ¡°There you go. You¡¯re done.¡± ¡°Wow. Thanks for your help.¡± [GUN CLICKS] It took me about six hours to build my ghost gun. [GUN CLICKS] If I had to do it again, I could do it much faster. Still, there¡¯s no guarantee that it will work. ¡°Scot Thomasson.¡± ¡°Jeremy White.¡± ¡°Nice to meet you.¡± ¡°Good to meet you.¡± ¡°How are you?¡± ¡°Good.¡± ¡°Good. It¡¯s the same damn gun.¡± ¡°Really is.¡± ¡°The difference is right there, serial number. And that¡¯s important.¡± Scot Thomasson is a retired A.T.F. agent. He¡¯s letting me try out my new gun on his property. ¡°Looks O.K. Looks like it¡¯s not going to blow up anybody¡¯s hand, so that¡¯s a good thing.¡± ¡°Let¡¯s go test it out.¡± [GUN CLICKS] [GUN FIRES] ¡°Hit.¡± [GUN FIRES] ¡°Hit.¡± [GUN FIRES] ¡°O.K.¡± ¡°That¡¯s a working gun.¡± ¡°Yeah, sure enough is. Listen, I worked violent crime my whole career for 26 years. You want those officers to have every means possible bringing to justice those who use that firearm to commit acts of violence. And without a serial number on that firearm, you can¡¯t do it.¡± ¡°So if these kits had a serial number and were sold through licensed dealers, do you see any problem with that?¡± ¡°No problem whatsoever. So what?¡± ¡°Right now we really don¡¯t know what we don¡¯t know, because these guns are completely untraceable.¡± Jennifer Wexton is a representative from Virginia¡¯s 10th district and a co-sponsor on two bills that would broaden the definition of firearms to include assembly kits. so you couldn¡¯t buy them without the government knowing. ¡°Normally the serial number would be here.¡± ¡°No. And look, there¡¯s nothing there.¡± ¡°There¡¯s nothing there.¡± ¡°Yeah. That¡¯s part of the allure of these kinds of ghost guns, by the way. So when they¡¯re picked up in crime scenes and things like that, we know that they are out there. And we¡¯re seeing it happen more and more.¡± ¡°What do you say to the Second Amendment advocate that says, these laws are an invasion of my privacy when it comes to gun ownership?¡± ¡°I think that guns should be traceable. So I think that weighing the interest in not having a serial number on your firearm versus the overall public safety, I come down on the side of public safety.¡± In the end, the government does find out about my ghost gun. Without a handgun license, I can¡¯t bring this gun back to New York, so I¡¯m turning it in to the local police. They interview me, do a background check and file a police report. That¡¯s a lot more screening than I went through to get the gun in the first place. For most people, this isn¡¯t the easiest way to get a gun. It takes time and skill. Some people may like that challenge. Most people would rather just buy one from a gun shop or a licensed dealer. But if you¡¯re a felon, or underage, or you can¡¯t legally buy a gun for some other reason, these kits make it remarkably easy to get one anyway. Judge Reed O¡¯Connor, of the Federal District Court for the Northern District of Texas, sided with the challengers and struck down the regulation in July, saying that ¡°a weapon parts kit is not a firearm¡± and ¡°that which may become or may be converted to a functional receiver is not itself a receiver.¡± He added: ¡°Even if it is true that such an interpretation creates loopholes that as a policy matter should be avoided, it is not the role of the judiciary to correct them. That is up to Congress.¡± A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, refused to stay key aspects of Judge O¡¯Connor¡¯s ruling. When the Supreme Court struck down a New York gun control law last year on Second Amendment grounds, it split along familiar lines, with the six Republican appointees in the majority and the three Democratic ones in dissent. The vote in the new case revealed a different fault line, with Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Barrett taking a more cautious approach than the other four conservatives. In the government¡¯s emergency application, Ms. Prelogar asked the justices to consider an analogy. ¡°Every speaker of English would recognize that a tax on sales of ¡®bookshelves¡¯ applies to Ikea when it sells boxes of parts and the tools and instructions for assembling them into bookshelves,¡± she wrote. A Supreme Court brief from one set of challengers said the comparison was flawed. ¡°A better analogy would be to a ¡®taco kit¡¯ sold as a bundle by a grocery store that includes taco shells, seasoning packets, salsa and other toppings, along with a slab of raw beef,¡± the brief said. ¡°No one would call the taco kit a taco. In addition to ¡®assembly,¡¯ turning it into one would require cutting or grinding and cooking the meat ? and until that was done, it would be nonsensical to treat it as food and the equivalent of a taco.¡± The two sides also differed on whether there has been a spike in homemade firearms. Ms. Prelogar wrote that there had been ¡°an explosion of crimes involving ghost guns,¡± pointing to a sworn statement from an A.T.F. official. More than 19,000 firearms without serial numbers were recovered by the authorities in 2021, the official said, compared with about 1,600 in 2017. He added that in the 11 months ending in July, ¡°a total of approximately 23,452 suspected privately made firearms were recovered at crime scenes and submitted for tracing.¡± Such weapons are particularly attractive to criminals and minors, Ms. Prelogar wrote, adding that they ¡°can be made from kits and parts that are available online to anyone with a credit card and that allow anyone with basic tools and rudimentary skills (or access to internet video tutorials) to assemble a fully functional firearm in as little as 20 minutes.¡± The challengers¡¯ brief questioned the Biden administration¡¯s data. ¡°The government¡¯s alleged ¡®epidemic¡¯ of privately made firearms traced by the police appears to be largely an artifact of police departments changing their tracing practices in response to A.T.F. pressure,¡± the brief said, adding that ¡°nothing in the government¡¯s submission demonstrates that firearms made by individuals for their own personal use are fueling an increase in crime.¡± The brief also objected to the phrase ¡°ghost guns,¡± calling it ¡°a propaganda term that appears nowhere in federal law¡± and one that includes both firearms ¡°that are manufactured lawfully by individuals and those that have their serial numbers illegally obliterated.¡± Adam Liptak covers the Supreme Court and writes Sidebar, a column on legal developments.

https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/11/us/new-york-gun-law-supreme-court.html?searchResultPosition=38,2023-01-11,Supreme Court Leaves New York¡¯s Gun Law in Place for Now,"The law, enacted in response to a decision in June striking down a restrictive gun control law, imposed new requirements on carrying guns in public. By Adam Liptak WASHINGTON ? The Supreme Court on Wednesday allowed New York to enforce, for now, a law placing strict limits on guns outside the home that was enacted in response to a landmark ruling in June. The court¡¯s brief, unsigned order gave no reasons, which is typical when the justices act on emergency applications. Challenges to the new law are pending before the federal appeals court in New York. In a statement, Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, said the law ¡°presents novel and serious questions.¡± But he added that the appeals court should address those questions first, so long as it does so promptly. The law, enacted in July, requires people seeking gun licenses to show that they have ¡°good moral character¡± and bans guns in many public locations. In addition, the law bans guns on private property unless the owner consents to their presence. Six New Yorkers, backed by a gun rights group, challenged the law in the case brought to the Supreme Court, saying it violated the Second Amendment and flouted the court¡¯s decision in June, New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen. The group that filed the suit, Gun Owners of America, says it is the ¡°¡®no compromise¡¯ gun lobby.¡± In the Bruen decision, a six-justice majority struck down a law that required people seeking a license to carry a handgun in public to demonstrate that they had a ¡°proper cause.¡± The Second Amendment, Justice Thomas wrote for the majority, protects ¡°an individual¡¯s right to carry a handgun for self-defense outside the home.¡± The gun law, he wrote, gave local officials too much discretion and placed an intolerable burden on Second Amendment rights. Justice Thomas wrote that states remained free to ban guns in sensitive places, giving a few examples: schools, government buildings, legislative assemblies, polling places and courthouses. But he cautioned that ¡°expanding the category of ¡®sensitive places¡¯ simply to all places of public congregation that are not isolated from law enforcement defines the category of ¡®sensitive places¡¯ far too broadly.¡± In a concurring opinion, Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., wrote that laws that used objective criteria in deciding who is entitled to carry guns in public remained presumptively constitutional. States were generally free to require, he wrote, ¡°fingerprinting, a background check, a mental health records check, and training in firearms handling and in laws regarding the use of force.¡± After the decision, Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York convened an extraordinary legislative session to seek an alternative law, vowing to combat a ¡°gun violence crisis.¡± ¡°They may think they can change our lives with the stroke of a pen, but we have pens, too,¡± she told reporters during the session, in July. State lawmakers ultimately passed a new law that they said protected public safety while complying with the Supreme Court¡¯s decision. But in November, Judge Glenn T. Suddaby of the Federal District Court in Syracuse, N.Y., blocked many aspects of the new law in a 184-page opinion that drew on the methodology endorsed by the Supreme Court in the Bruen decision. Judge Suddaby blocked the law¡¯s ¡°good moral character¡± requirement along with some disclosures called for by the law, including the identification of family members and social media accounts. He also halted the law¡¯s restrictions on carrying guns in, among other places, houses of worship, public parks, zoos, buses, theaters and establishments serving alcohol. The judge also blocked the law¡¯s prohibition on carrying firearms onto private property without the owner¡¯s consent. A unanimous three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit put Judge Suddaby¡¯s ruling on hold while an appeal moved forward. The plaintiffs then asked the Supreme Court to step in. The new law¡¯s ¡°good moral character¡± requirement, the plaintiffs wrote, ¡°is no less subject to the unbridled discretion of licensing officials and makes the licensing process even more difficult than before.¡± And its ban of guns in sensitive places, they wrote, encompasses almost the entire state. The new law, they wrote, ¡°was designed not as a public safety measure, but rather a political statement demonstrating New York¡¯s contempt for this court¡¯s Bruen decision.¡± In response, lawyers for the state urged the Supreme Court to leave the new law in place while legal challenges moved forward. The state¡¯s brief said the plaintiffs had not suffered the sort of injury that gave them standing to sue, noting that five of them had licenses to carry guns and that the sixth had not tried to secure a license. The brief added that the ¡°good moral character¡± requirement had been an independent feature of New York¡¯s licensing law for more than a century and was needed to ensure that licenses were given to law-abiding citizens who would not endanger themselves or others. The ¡°proper cause¡± requirement struck down in Bruen, the filing said, had a different purpose: requiring a special justification for carrying a gun. The state¡¯s lawyers said in the brief that the plaintiffs had overstated the sweep of the new law¡¯s restrictions on carrying guns in sensitive places. The law¡¯s limits, the lawyers said, tracked ¡°longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms in places like fairs, markets, election sites, places of worship, courts, schools, places of public assembly and so forth.¡± Adam Liptak covers the Supreme Court and writes Sidebar, a column on legal developments.

Meeting,"The current and potential 2024 presidential candidates showed strong support for gun owners¡¯ rights ? a core issue for the party¡¯s base, but one that can be a tougher sell in a general election. By Katie Glueck Reporting from Indianapolis. They cited Scripture and issued calls for prayer. They applauded law enforcement and demanded tighter security in schools. They lamented the nation¡¯s mental health crisis and offered tough talk about the death penalty. But as the most prominent current and potential Republican presidential candidates spoke before the annual gathering of the National Rifle Association, most virulently rejected the idea that more gun restrictions could curb bloodshed, even as two American cities are still mourning the latest massacres in the nation¡¯s gun violence epidemic. ¡°This is not a gun problem,¡± insisted former President Donald J. Trump in a dark and meandering speech on Friday afternoon. ¡°The only way to stop these wicked acts is to ensure that any sicko who would shoot up a school knows that within seconds, not minutes, they will face certain death.¡± He also nodded to the party¡¯s focus on crime, saying that the issue is not too many guns, but ¡°too many thugs, hoodlums and savage criminals on our street.¡± Mike Pence, Mr. Trump¡¯s vice president, who faced boos as he took the stage, also toed the line. ¡°Stop trampling on the God-given rights of the American people every time tragedy happens,¡± Mr. Pence said, directing his comments at ¡°gun control extremists.¡± And to warm applause, Gov. Kristi Noem of South Dakota signed an executive order onstage ¡°to protect the God-given right to keep and bear arms from being infringed upon by financial institutions.¡± In many ways, the gathering was part of a pattern ? a devastating mass shooting, followed by Republican displays of fealty to a group that rejects even many modest efforts to curb gun violence ? that underscores a central and deepening tension in the broader American culture wars. In 2018, prominent Republicans affirmed their strong support for gun owners¡¯ rights at the N.R.A. meeting three months after a gunman had murdered 17 people in Parkland, Fla. In 2022, they descended on the N.R.A.¡¯s event a few days after a gunman had killed 21 in Uvalde, Texas. And on Friday, they spoke at the N.R.A.¡¯s convention in Indianapolis, even as Nashville and Louisville, Ky., are still grappling with the aftermath of recent mass shootings.  Despite a relentless drumbeat of gun violence that has outraged the public, galvanized a youth movement and spurred Democrats and some Republicans to action, conservative activists and organizations like the N.R.A. still often demand unwavering and effectively unlimited allegiance to the rights of gun owners, complicating any effort by candidates to meet the alarmed mood of the nation without alienating the base. On Friday, some of the current and would-be candidates did not even attempt to navigate a balancing act. ¡°I¡¯ve resisted calls to take up gun control even when such a stand is superficially unpopular,¡± said Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, who recently signed a bill allowing Florida residents to carry concealed guns without a permit. He spoke briefly by video, as did Nikki Haley, a former ambassador to the United Nations; Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina; and Mike Pompeo, a former secretary of state, who said Friday that he was not running for president. ¡°I understand that it is precisely at those moments when a right is unpopular that it needs true champions,¡± Mr. DeSantis said. Mr. Trump, for his part, focused only briefly on last month¡¯s shooting at a Nashville school during a lengthy address that, though well received, also saw attendees leaving in noticeable numbers about 40 minutes in. He highlighted a number of proposals related to the topic at hand, such as encouraging teachers to pursue concealed-carry firearm training, or a measure that would allow concealed-carry reciprocity across states. But the former president, who was recently indicted, also lashed the left in vicious terms, complained about his myriad legal troubles, touted his poll numbers by flashing them on screens, talked about taking over ¡°management¡± of Washington D.C., and mocked some of his political rivals. In particular, he seemed to delight in the jeering that?Mr. Pence, a former governor here, had received as he took the stage earlier, a reminder of the now-tense relationship between the two men after Mr. Pence refused to try to overturn the 2020 election. Mr. Pence, in his speech, laid out a range of proposals including funding for armed school resource officers and a federal death penalty statute that would ¡°ensure that those who engage in mass shootings face execution in months, not years.¡±  The event also drew other announced and possible candidates, including former Gov. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas; Vivek Ramaswamy, an entrepreneur, author and ¡°anti-woke¡± activist who received an energetic reception as he detailed proposals like one to abolish the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; and Gov.?Chris Sununu of New Hampshire, who is viewed as more moderate on many issues. The appearances ? both virtual and in person ? of some of the most talked-about presidential candidates were expected, said Robert Blizzard, a Republican pollster. ¡°In states like Iowa and New Hampshire, which are really the only states that matter on the calendar for the time being, most Republican primary voters are gun owners and strong supporters of the N.R.A.,¡± he said. The N.R.A. meeting was on the books well before the most recent shootings, though?the violence did not appear to prompt high-profile invitees to skip the event, in contrast to last year¡¯s gathering, when some Republicans took a pass after the mass shooting in?Uvalde. Some in the nascent 2024 field were also expected in Nashville this weekend for a Republican donor retreat ? a choice of?venue that has left some in the grieving city on edge. The issue of guns, which inspires great zeal among many Republican primary voters, gets far more complex in general elections. Voters rarely cite guns as their most important issue in general elections. But public sentiment is clear: A recent Morning Consult poll found that 67 percent of voters supported stricter gun control laws, including nearly half of Republicans surveyed. And Democrats have used Republican inaction on the issue as part of their broader argument that the G.O.P. is outside the American mainstream, an effective message in last year¡¯s midterm elections. ¡°One of the challenges that Republicans face in suburban areas across the country is they are being viewed, in light of Trump, in light of abortion, and to some extent on guns,¡± Mr. Blizzard said, ¡°as being a little bit too extreme on their positions.¡± He stressed that the gun issue had not been as politically potent as strong feelings about Mr. Trump or abortion rights, and that the defense of Second Amendment rights ¡°is part of the Republican Party¡¯s DNA.¡± The political impact of mass shootings has not been lost on Republican leaders, however. Senator Mitch McConnell, the minority leader, said as much last year as the Senate approved bipartisan legislation intended to curb gun violence. Mr. McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, said he hoped ¡°it will be viewed favorably by voters in the suburbs we need.¡± And John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, said in an interview that the approval of the N.R.A. ? an organization that faced significant internal challenges in recent years ? has ¡°turned toxic, and certainly turned toxic when it comes to a general election and you¡¯re trying to appeal to independents and swing voters.¡± In a briefing with the news media on Thursday organized by the Democratic National Committee, Senator Christopher Murphy of Connecticut, a Democrat who has been heavily involved in efforts to combat gun violence, said that Republicans were courting electoral disaster with their approach to guns. ¡°As the Republican Party continues to give the middle finger to kids,¡± he said, ¡°they are just asking for an electoral tidal wave.¡± On Friday, Wayne LaPierre, the longtime N.R.A. leader, offered his own political analysis. ¡°Gun-hating politicians should never go to bed unafraid of what this association and all of our millions of members can do to their political careers,¡± he declared, to cheers in the hall.

By Jacey Fortin The mother of a 6-year-old who shot his first-grade teacher in a Virginia classroom pleaded guilty on Monday to federal criminal charges for using marijuana while owning a firearm, and making false statements about drug use when she bought the gun. The mother, Deja Taylor, was previously indicted by a grand jury in Virginia?on state criminal charges of neglect and endangerment, in connection with her son¡¯s access to the handgun that he used in the shooting. This time, the federal authorities focused on her purchase and ownership of the gun, which, she acknowledged in her plea on Monday, was illegal given the extent of her marijuana use. Although recreational marijuana is allowed in Virginia, federal laws prohibit addicted or ¡°unlawful¡± drug users from owning a gun. The charges, which came last week, are the latest development in a case that has drawn national attention amid charged debates over guns and school safety. The January shooting in a first-grade classroom in Newport News, Va.,?stunned the community because of the child¡¯s age and raised questions about the school¡¯s response and the boy¡¯s access to the weapon. The teacher, Abigail Zwerner, had been in the middle of a routine lesson when, the police said, the boy pulled out the gun, aimed it at her and fired. A single bullet passed through her hand and struck her chest; she was seriously injured but survived. The child has not been charged. According to court documents filed on Monday, federal agents searched a garbage bin at Ms. Taylor¡¯s home days after the shooting and ¡°found copious amounts of marijuana, and packaging for marijuana edibles.¡± They later found marijuana in Ms. Taylor¡¯s purse and in a bedroom of a home where she had been staying with her mother. Prosecutors said Ms. Taylor had admitted ¡°that her chronic use of marijuana was not recreational, and it affected her behavior.¡± In July 2022, when Ms. Taylor bought the gun from Winfree Firearms in Yorktown, Va., she checked a box on a form to indicate that she was not ¡°an unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any depressant, stimulant, narcotic drug or any other controlled substance,¡± according to court documents. That assertion led to last week¡¯s federal charges of making a false statement while purchasing a firearm, and unlawfully using a controlled substance while owning a gun. Initially, the police?said that the weapon was?legally purchased by Ms. Taylor. A lawyer for the family, James Ellenson, has said that the gun was stored on a top shelf of the mother¡¯s bedroom closet and had a trigger lock. Gene Rossi, also a lawyer for Ms. Taylor, said on Monday that the case was ¡°a perfect storm of horrible consequences.¡± He added that sentencing for the federal charges was expected in October, and that both sides had agreed that punishment would not exceed a 24-month prison sentence. Prosecutors for the U.S. Attorney¡¯s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The trial on the state charges is expected to start in August. ¡°Her role in this tragedy is a complete mistake and an accident,¡± Mr. Rossi said. ¡°However, she accepts all responsibility for her son¡¯s actions and has tremendous guilt over what happened.¡± Advertisement",NYT

Volunteers erected a memorial outside the entrance to Allen Premium Outlets in Allen, Texas, a day after a gunman killed eight people and wounded seven others.Credit...Cooper Neill for The New York Times Supported by By J. David Goodman,?Adam Goldman,?Edgar Sandoval and David Montgomery HOUSTON ? After months of pleading for more gun control measures, a Democrat who represents Uvalde, Texas, where 19 children died in a mass shooting, was told by the Republican leader of the State Senate to stop bringing up gun legislation or be barred from speaking at all. In the State House, Republican members talked and joked among themselves as another Democrat, Representative Jarvis Johnson of Houston, rose to discuss gun control. ¡°This is not a joke ? this is real,¡± he shouted from the lectern at his colleagues on Friday. ¡°Children every day are dying.¡± It was only hours later that gunfire again ripped apart the daily life of people in Texas. This time the violence erupted at a popular shopping center in the Dallas suburb of Allen, where a 33-year-old gunman armed with what officials said was an AR-15-style rifle swiftly killed eight people and wounded at least seven others, including at least one child, before a police officer fatally shot him on Saturday. The killings came just over a week after a mass shooting in rural San Jacinto County, north of Houston, where five people living together were killed by a neighbor after they asked him to stop shooting his gun in his front yard. And they occurred a little less than a year after the massacre at Uvalde, where two teachers also died. Among some Texans, the drumbeat of mass murder has fueled rising frustration and a slight openness to more gun regulation in a state where even Democrats proudly discuss their firearms. But the violence has done little to reshape the political realities in the State Capitol, where Republicans control both legislative chambers and all statewide offices. In the past two years, as the state has been shaken by more than a dozen mass killings of four or more people, Texas has increased access to firearms, doing away with its permit requirements to carry handguns and lowering the age when adults can carry handguns to 18 from 21. On Sunday, Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, attended a vigil for the victims of the shooting at the shopping center, Allen Premium Outlets, but said earlier that there would be no new effort by his administration to limit access to firearms ? because it would not work. ¡°We¡¯ve seen an increased number of shootings in states with easy gun laws as well as shootings in states with very strict gun laws,¡± Mr. Abbott said in an interview on Fox News. He said Texas was responding to the ¡°dramatic increase in the amount of anger¡± across the United States by going to ¡°its root cause, which is addressing the mental health problems behind it.¡± The message was largely the same as one delivered by the governor the day after the elementary school shooting in Uvalde in May 2022, when he observed during a news conference that more people are shot in Chicago each weekend than in Texas schools. By contrast, President Biden urged action on Sunday. ¡°Republican members of Congress cannot continue to meet this epidemic with a shrug,¡± he said in a statement that called for ¡°a bill banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.¡± In Texas, a bill to raise the age to purchase an AR-15-style rifle to 21 from 18 has been introduced by Democrats and championed by the relatives of the children killed in Uvalde, but it was not likely to pass out of committee before a legislative deadline on Monday. That legislation would have prevented the 18-year-old gunman in Uvalde from purchasing the weapon he used, but it would not have been a factor in the shooting in Allen, where the gunman was older. Investigators on Sunday were still working to determine what had motivated that gunman to open fire at the shopping center, about 25 miles north of Dallas. It was the second-deadliest shooting of the year in the United States, after the Monterey Park, Calif., massacre in which a gunman killed 11 people in a ballroom on Jan. 21. The Texas Department of Public Safety identified the gunman in Saturday¡¯s attack as Mauricio Garcia, 33, of Dallas. A video circulating on social media appeared to show him lying on the ground, clad in black and equipped with what appeared to be a tactical vest, multiple rounds of ammunition and a long gun. The gunman may have espoused white supremacist ideology, according to two law enforcement officials, but it was not yet known whether the shooting was an act of domestic terrorism. He arrived at the large outdoor mall in the midafternoon on Saturday, stepped from a silver sedan and at around 3:30 p.m. began firing a rifle at shoppers walking outside. According to video taken at the scene, the gunfire sent people running for safety. A police officer who had been on an unrelated assignment at the mall heard gunfire, rushed toward it and fatally shot the gunman, Chief Brian E. Harvey of the Allen Police Department said on Saturday. Officers and agents from multiple law enforcement agencies including the local police, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Texas Department of Public Safety were still working on Sunday to identify the victims and notify their families. The injured ? who ranged in age from 5 to 61 ? were being treated at three trauma centers, according to a spokesman for one of the centers, Medical City Healthcare. No update on the investigation was provided on Sunday, but gun control proponents in the state were deploring the report of yet another episode of large-scale violence. ¡°This is no longer unimaginable,¡± Representative Johnson said in an interview on Sunday. ¡°We are almost to the point of normalizing mass shootings in Texas, and that is the most disturbing thing.¡± While less supportive of stricter gun regulation than Americans as a whole, Texans support some limited gun control measures, polls have shown, and over the past few years views on guns among Republican voters in Texas have appeared to moderate somewhat, according to polls by the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas at Austin. In 2020, 67 percent of Republicans told pollsters that more guns made the United States safer. The next year, that percentage declined, and, after the Uvalde shooting, it declined again, to 57 percent. ¡°You are seeing a very slow erosion in some of the underlying attitudes that suggest a blanket enthusiasm for guns among Republicans,¡± James Henson, director of the Texas Politics Project, said. ¡°But it¡¯s not dropping enough to signal a change, at least not yet.¡± State Senator Roland Gutierrez, a Democrat who represents Uvalde, said that after the elementary school massacre two of his Republican colleagues privately voiced support to him for some kind of gun control measures. ¡°But since then, nothing has changed,¡± he said in an interview on Sunday. For months, Mr. Gutierrez has been trying to force action in the State Senate, a body dominated by its Republican leader, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who warned Mr. Gutierrez last month against discussing gun control during a debate on an unrelated bill to ban minors from drag shows. ¡°People don¡¯t want to eliminate these guns, I get it ? and I own guns myself,¡± Mr. Gutierrez said. But there are steps that can be taken, he said, such as expanding background checks or raising the age to buy an AR-15-style rifle. ¡°This is simple stuff,¡± he said. In Allen on Sunday, Amy Bennett stood on the side of a road near Cottonwood Creek Church, where the vigil for the shooting victims was being held. She held a sign that said ¡°This voter opposes gun violence,¡± with a picture of an AR-15 crossed out. ¡°Thoughts and prayers are useless,¡± said another sign pinned to her shirt. ¡°The dead are still dead.¡± Several cars honked as they passed by. For some Texans, like Annalisha Tiller, 48, a Republican who lives in the neighborhood of San Jacinto County where last month¡¯s mass shooting took place, the ease with which anyone can get a gun has made her feel unsafe and open to restrictions such as requiring background checks for weapons purchased at gun shows. ¡°Access to guns is too easy here,¡± she said. At the same time, she arms herself whenever she goes out, for safety. ¡°We don¡¯t have police out here to protect us,¡± she said. ¡°I want good people with guns.¡± Mamie Lester, 59, a steadfast Republican who lives on a 50-acre farm in North Texas, said she and her husband had more than a dozen guns ? rifles, shotguns and pistols ? that remain carefully locked up in their home when not in use. But the killings in Allen, coming after other recent mass shootings, has deepened her feeling that something has to be done. ¡°I do realize that this is all out of control,¡± she said. ¡°I¡¯m not totally against gun control, but they¡¯re trying to control it for the wrong people. You¡¯ve got to keep the guns out the hands of the criminals.¡± She said better background checks could be an answer. Gregory K. Taggart, a firearms trainer at Texas Legends, a gun range in Allen near where the latest shooting occurred, echoed Governor Abbott when he said that mental health needed to be considered in any analysis of recent gun violence. ¡°Guns have been around forever. Mass shootings have not been,¡± Mr. Taggart said. ¡°My first question would be, Why do we have mass shootings now? I think our society is breaking down.¡± Restricting guns is not the answer, he added. ¡°When people talk about drunk driving, do they say, Let¡¯s ban cars?¡± Part of the reason Republicans in Texas may not feel political pressure on the issue is the state¡¯s recent electoral history. The Uvalde shooting took place during a hard-fought governor¡¯s race between Mr. Abbott, running for a third term, and Beto O¡¯Rourke, a former Democratic congressman who campaigned for some of the same gun control proposals that have recently been before the legislature. Mr. Abbott won by a wide margin. Last month, relatives of victims in Uvalde traveled to the State Capitol to testify on behalf of the bill to raise the age for buying an AR-15-style rifle. The fact that a committee in the Republican-controlled House even agreed to listen to them had felt to them like a kind of victory. Then they waited for hours for their turn to speak. They were finally called in after 10 p.m., about 13 hours after they arrived at the Capitol that morning. ¡°I¡¯m reminded of May 24, 2022, when we waited hours to be told our daughter would never come home,¡± Kimberly Rubio told the committee through tears, speaking of her daughter Lexie, who was killed in the shooting. ¡°I expressed confusion then, and I¡¯m perplexed now. Did you think we would go home?¡± Mary Beth Gahan, Remy Tumin, Claire Fahy and Lauren McCarthy contributed reporting. J. David Goodman is the Houston bureau chief, covering Texas.

Tony Earls hung his head before a row of television cameras, staring down, his life upended. Days before, Mr. Earls had pulled out his handgun and opened fire, hoping to strike a man who had just robbed him and his wife at an A.T.M. in Houston. Instead, he struck Arlene Alvarez, a 9-year-old girl seated in a passing pickup, killing her. ¡°Is Mr. Earls licensed to carry?¡± a reporter asked during the February news conference, in which his lawyer spoke for him. He didn¡¯t need one, the lawyer replied. ¡°Everything about that situation, we believe and contend, was justified under Texas law.¡± A grand jury later agreed, declining to indict Mr. Earls for any crime. The shooting was part of what many sheriffs, police leaders and district attorneys in urban areas of Texas say has been an increase in people carrying weapons and in spur-of-the-moment gunfire in the year since the state began allowing most adults 21 or over to carry a handgun without a license. At the same time, mainly in rural counties, other sheriffs said they had seen little change, and proponents of gun rights said more people lawfully carrying guns could be part of why shootings have declined in some parts of the state. Far from an outlier, Texas, with its new law, joined what has been an expanding effort to remove nearly all restrictions on carrying handguns. When Alabama¡¯s ¡°permitless carry¡± law goes into effect in January, half of the states in the nation, from Maine to Arizona, will not require a license to carry a handgun. The state-by-state legislative push has coincided with a federal judiciary that has increasingly ruled in favor of carrying guns and against state efforts to regulate them. But Texas is the most populous state to do away with handgun permit requirements. Five of the nation¡¯s 15 biggest cities are in Texas, making the permitless approach to handguns a new fact of life in urban areas to an extent not seen in other states. In the border town of Eagle Pass, drunken arguments have flared into shootings. In El Paso, revelers who legally bring their guns to parties have opened fire to stop fights. In and around Houston, prosecutors have received a growing stream of cases involving guns brandished or fired over parking spots, bad driving, loud music and love triangles. ¡°It seems like now there¡¯s been a tipping point where just everybody is armed,¡± said Sheriff Ed Gonzalez of Harris County, which includes Houston. No statewide shooting statistics have been released since the law went into effect last September. After a particularly violent 2021 in many parts of the state, the picture of crime in Texas has been mixed this year, with homicides and assaults up in some places and down in others. But what has been clear is that far fewer people are getting new licenses for handguns even as many in law enforcement say the number of guns they encounter on the street has been increasing. Big city police departments and major law enforcement groups opposed the new handgun law when it came before the State Legislature last spring, worried in part about the loss of training requirements necessary for a permit and more dangers for officers. But gun rights proponents prevailed in the Republican-dominated Capitol, arguing that Texans should not need the state¡¯s permission to exercise their Second Amendment rights. Recent debates over gun laws in Texas have not been limited to handgun licensing. After the elementary school shooting in Uvalde, gun control advocates have pushed to raise the age to purchase an AR-15-style rifle. And after the Supreme Court struck down New York¡¯s restrictive licensing program, a federal court in Texas found that a state law barring adults under 21 from carrying a handgun was unconstitutional. Gov. Greg Abbott has suggested he agreed, even as the Texas Department of Public Safety, which oversees the state police, is appealing. ¡°What I believe in is that the Second Amendment provides certain rights, and it provides those rights to adults,¡± Mr. Abbott said in a recent news conference. ¡°I think that the court ruling is going to be upheld.¡± The loosening of regulations also landed in the middle of a national debate over crime. Researchers have long argued over the effect of allowing more people to legally own and carry guns. But a series of recent studies has found a link between laws that make it easier to carry a handgun and increases in crime, and some have raised the possibility that more guns in circulation lead to more thefts of weapons and to more shootings by the police. ¡°The weight of the evidence has shifted in the direction that more guns equals more crime,¡± said John J. Donohue III, a Stanford Law School professor and the author of several recent studies looking at gun regulations and crime. Much of the research has been around the effects of making handgun licenses easier to obtain, part of what are known as right-to-carry laws, and Mr. Donohue cautioned that only limited data is available on laws that in most cases require no licenses at all. ¡°I think most people are reasoning by analogy: If you thought that right-to-carry was harmful, this will be worse,¡± he said. But John R. Lott Jr., a longtime researcher whose 1998 book, ¡°More Guns, Less Crime,¡± has been influential among proponents of gun rights, said the newer studies did not take into account differences between state handgun regulations that might account for increases in crime. He also pointed to some recent crime declines in Texas cities after the permitless carry law went into effect, and to what he saw as the importance of increasing lawful gun ownership in high-crime areas. ¡°If my research convinces me of anything,¡± Mr. Lott said, ¡°it¡¯s that you¡¯re going to get the biggest reduction in crime if the people who are most likely victims of violent crime, predominantly poor Blacks, are the ones who are getting the permits.¡± In Dallas, there has been a rise in the number of homicides deemed to be justifiable, such as those conducted in self-defense, even as overall shootings have declined from last year¡¯s high levels. ¡°We¡¯ve had justifiable shootings where potential victims have defended themselves,¡± said the Dallas police chief, Eddie Garcia. ¡°It cuts both ways.¡± Last October in Port Arthur, Texas, a man with a handgun, who had a license, saw two armed robbers at a Church¡¯s Chicken and fired through the drive-through window, fatally striking one of the men and wounding the other. His actions were praised by the local district attorney. Michael Mata, the president of the local police union in Dallas, said that he and his fellow officers had seen no increase in violent crime tied to the new permitless carry law, though there were ¡°absolutely¡± more guns on the street. Sheriff David Soward of Atascosa County, a rural area south of San Antonio, said he had also seen no apparent increase in shootings. ¡°Only a small percentage of people actually take advantage of the law,¡± he said. But for many law enforcement officers, the connection between the new law and spontaneous shootings has been readily apparent. ¡°Now that everybody can carry a weapon, we have people who drink and start shooting each other,¡± said Sheriff Tom Schmerber of Maverick County, which includes Eagle Pass. ¡°People get emotional,¡± he said, ¡°and instead of reaching for a fist, they reach for a weapon. We¡¯ve had several shootings like that.¡± Handgun licenses are still available. The process involves a background check and a roughly five-hour training course, including on a shooting range, that covers the legal troubles that can arise when opening fire. The number of new permits sought by Texans surged with the pandemic, but then sharply declined through 2021, as the permitless carry bill moved through the Legislature. An average of fewer than 5,000 a month were issued in 2022, lower than at any point going back to 2017. Many Texans still seek the license because of the benefits it affords, including the ability to carry a concealed handgun into a government meeting. But it is no longer necessary. ¡°Somebody could go into Academy Sporting Goods here in El Paso and purchase a handgun and walk out with it after their background check,¡± said Ryan Urrutia, a commander at the El Paso Sheriff¡¯s office. ¡°It really puts law enforcement at a disadvantage because it puts more guns on the street that can be used against us.¡± The law still bars carrying a handgun for those convicted of a felony, who are intoxicated or committing another crime. In Harris County, criminal cases involving illegal weapons possession have sharply increased since the new law went into effect: 3,500 so far this year, as of the middle of October, versus 2,300 in all of 2021 and an average of about 1,000 cases in prior years going back to 2012. ¡°It¡¯s shocking,¡± said Kim Ogg, the Harris County district attorney. ¡°We¡¯ve seen more carrying weapons, which by itself would be legal. But people are carrying the weapons while committing other crimes, and I¡¯m not talking just about violent crimes. I¡¯m talking about intoxication crimes or driving crimes or property crimes, carrying weapons on school property or in another prohibited place,¡± including bars and school grounds. Her office provided a sampling of arrests in the last few weeks: a 21-year-old man carrying a pistol and a second magazine while walking through the grounds of an elementary school during school hours; a man jumping from his car and opening fire at the driver of Tesla in a fit of road rage; a woman, while helping her little brother into a car, turning to shoot at another woman after an argument over a social media video. In the case of Mr. Earls, the man accused of fatally shooting 9-year-old Arlene Alvarez while shooting at a fleeing robber, Ms. Ogg¡¯s office presented evidence to a grand jury of charges ranging from negligent homicide to murder. The grand jury rejected those charges. A lawyer for Mr. Earls declined to make him available to comment. The man who robbed Mr. Earls and his wife remains unidentified, Ms. Ogg said. In May, a committee of the Texas House heard testimony from gun rights advocates who praised the passage of permitless carry and argued that it may be time to go further. Rachel Malone, of Gun Owners of America, outlined some of her group¡¯s priorities for the next legislative session. ¡°I think it would be appropriate to move the age for permitless carry to 18,¡± she told the committee. ¡°There¡¯s really no reason why a legal adult should not be able to defend themselves.¡± Audio produced by Jack D¡¯Isidoro.

https://www.nytimes.com/explain/2023/gun-control/why-is-it-so-hard-to-push-for-legislation?searchResultPosition=47,2023-01-26,"Gun Control, Explained","A quick guide to the debate over gun legislation in the United States. By The New York Times As the number of mass shootings in America continues to rise, gun control ? a term used to describe a wide range of restrictions and measures aimed at controlling the use of firearms ? remains at the center of heated discussions among proponents and opponents of stricter gun laws.  To help understand the debate and its political and social implications, we addressed some key questions on the subject.  Is gun control effective? What gun control measures exist at the federal level? What are gun buyback programs and do they work? Where does the U.S. public stand on the issue? What do opponents of gun control argue? Why is it so hard to push for legislation? Throughout the world, mass shootings have frequently been met with a common response: Officials impose new restrictions on gun ownership. Mass shootings become rarer. Homicides and suicides tend to decrease, too. After a British gunman killed 16 people in 1987, the country banned semiautomatic weapons like the ones he had used. It did the same with most handguns after a school shooting in 1996. It now has one of the lowest gun-related death rates in the developed world. In Australia, a 1996 massacre prompted mandatory gun buybacks in which, by some estimates, as many as one million firearms were then melted into slag. The rate of mass shootings plummeted. Only the United States, whose rate and severity of mass shootings is without parallel outside conflict zones, has so consistently refused to respond to those events with tightened gun laws. Several theories to explain the number of shootings in the United States ? like its unusually violent societal, class and racial divides, or its shortcomings in providing mental health care ? have been debunked by research. But one variable remains: the astronomical number of guns in the country. America¡¯s gun homicide rate was 33 per one million people in 2009, far exceeding the average among developed countries. In Canada and Britain, it was 5 per million and 0.7 per million, respectively, which also corresponds with differences in gun ownership. Americans sometimes see this as an expression of its deeper problems with crime, a notion ingrained, in part, by a series of films portraying urban gang violence in the early 1990s. But the United States is not actually more prone to crime than other developed countries, according to a landmark 1999 study by Franklin E. Zimring and Gordon Hawkins of the University of California, Berkeley. Rather, they found, in data that has since been repeatedly confirmed, that American crime is simply more lethal. A New Yorker is just as likely to be robbed as a Londoner, for instance, but the New Yorker is 54 times more likely to be killed in the process. They concluded that the discrepancy, like so many other anomalies of American violence, came down to guns. More gun ownership corresponds with more gun murders across virtually every axis: among developed countries, among American states, among American towns and cities and when controlling for crime rates. And gun control legislation tends to reduce gun murders, according to a recent analysis of 130 studies from 10 countries. This suggests that the guns themselves cause the violence. ? Max Fisher and Josh Keller, Why Does the U.S. Have So Many Mass Shootings? Research Is Clear: Guns. Every mass shooting is, in some sense, a fringe event, driven by one-off factors like the ideology or personal circumstances of the assailant. The risk is impossible to fully erase. Still, the record is confirmed by reams of studies that have analyzed the effects of policies like Britain¡¯s and Australia¡¯s: When countries tighten gun control laws, it leads to fewer guns in private citizens¡¯ hands, which leads to less gun violence. Much of current federal gun control legislation is a baseline, governing who can buy, sell and use certain classes of firearms, with states left free to enact additional restrictions. Dealers must be licensed, and run background checks to ensure their buyers are not ¡°prohibited persons,¡± including felons or people with a history of domestic violence ? though private sellers at gun shows or online marketplaces are not required to run background checks. Federal law also highly restricts the sale of certain firearms, such as fully automatic rifles. The most recent federal legislation, a bipartisan effort passed last year after a gunman killed 19 children and two teachers at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, expanded background checks for buyers under 21 and closed what is known as the boyfriend loophole. It also strengthened existing bans on gun trafficking and straw purchasing. ? Aishvarya Kavi Gun buyback programs are short-term initiatives that provide incentives, such as money or gift cards, to convince people to surrender firearms to law enforcement, typically with no questions asked. These events are often held by governments or private groups at police stations, houses of worship and community centers. Guns that are collected are either destroyed or stored. Most programs strive to take guns off the streets, provide a safe place for firearm disposal and stir cultural changes in a community, according to Gun by Gun, a nonprofit dedicated to preventing gun violence. The first formal gun buyback program was held in Baltimore in 1974 after three police officers were shot and killed, according to the authors of the book ¡°Why We Are Losing the War on Gun Violence in the United States.¡± The initiative collected more than 13,000 firearms, but failed to reduce gun violence in the city. Hundreds of other buyback programs have since unfolded across the United States. In 1999, President Bill Clinton announced the nation¡¯s first federal gun buyback program. The $15 million program provided grants of up to $500,000 to police departments to buy and destroy firearms. Two years later, the Senate defeated efforts to extend financing for the program after the Bush administration called for it to end. Despite the popularity of gun buyback programs among certain anti-violence and anti-gun advocates, there is little data to suggest that they work. A study by the National Bureau of Economic Research, a private nonprofit, found that buyback programs adopted in U.S. cities were ineffective in deterring gun crime, firearm-related homicides or firearm-related suicides.  . Evidence showed that cities set the sale price of a firearm too low to considerably reduce the supply of weapons; most who participated in such initiatives came from low-crime areas and firearms that were typically collected were either older or not in good working order. Dr. Brendan Campbell, a pediatric surgeon at Connecticut Children¡¯s Medical Center and an author of one chapter in ¡°Why We Are Losing the War on Gun Violence in the United States,¡± said that buyback programs should collect significantly more firearms than they currently do in order to be more effective. Dr. Campbell said they should also offer higher prices for handguns and assault rifles. ¡°Those are the ones that are most likely to be used in crime,¡± and by people attempting suicide, he said. ¡°If you just give $100 for whatever gun, that¡¯s when you¡¯ll end up with all these old, rusted guns that are a low risk of causing harm in the community.¡± Mandatory buyback programs have been enacted elsewhere around the world. After a mass shooting in 1996, Australia put in place a nationwide buyback program, collecting somewhere between one in five and one in three privately held guns. The initiative mostly targeted semiautomatic rifles and many shotguns that, under new laws, were no longer permitted. New Zealand banned military-style semiautomatic weapons, assault rifles and some gun parts and began its own large-scale buyback program in 2019, after a terrorist attack on mosques in Christchurch. The authorities said that more than 56,000 prohibited firearms had been collected from about 32,000 people through the initiative. Expanded background checks for guns purchased routinely receive more than 80 or 90 percent support in polling. Nationally, a majority of Americans have supported stricter gun laws for decades. A Gallup poll conducted in June found that 55 percent of participants were in favor of a ban on the manufacture, possession and sale of semiautomatic guns. A majority of respondents also supported other measures, including raising the legal age at which people can purchase certain firearms, and enacting a 30-day waiting period for gun sales. But the jumps in demand for gun control that occur after mass shootings also tend to revert to the partisan mean as time passes. Gallup poll data shows that the percentage of participants who supported stricter gun laws receded to 57 percent in October from 66 percent in June, which was just weeks after mass shootings in Uvalde, Texas, and Buffalo. A PDK poll conducted after the shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde found that 72 percent of Republicans supported arming teachers, in contrast with 24 percent of Democrats. Opponents of gun control, including most Republican members of Congress, argue that proposals to limit access to firearms infringe on the right of citizens to bear arms enshrined in the Second Amendment to the Constitution. And they contend that mass shootings are not the result of easily accessible guns, but of criminals and mentally ill people bent on waging violence. ? Annie Karni Polling suggests that Americans broadly support gun control measures, yet legislation is often stymied in Washington, and Republicans rarely seem to pay a political price for their opposition. The calculation behind Republicans¡¯ steadfast stonewalling of any new gun regulations ? even in the face of the kind unthinkable massacres like in Uvalde, Texas ? is a fairly simple one for Senator Kevin Cramer of North Dakota. Asked what the reaction would be from voters back home if he were to support any significant form of gun control, the first-term Republican had a straightforward answer: ¡°Most would probably throw me out of office,¡± he said. His response helps explain why Republicans have resisted proposals such as the one for universal background checks for gun buyers, despite remarkably broad support from the public for such plans ? support that can reach up to 90 percent nationwide in some cases. Republicans like Mr. Cramer understand that they would receive little political reward for joining the push for laws to limit access to guns, including assault-style weapons. But they know for certain that they would be pounded ? and most likely left facing a primary opponent who could cost them their job ? for voting for gun safety laws or even voicing support for them. Most Republicans in the Senate represent deeply conservative states where gun ownership is treated as a sacred privilege enshrined in the Constitution, a privilege not to be infringed upon no matter how much blood is spilled in classrooms and school hallways around the country. Though the National Rifle Association has recently been diminished by scandal and financial turmoil, Democrats say that the organization still has a strong hold on Republicans through its financial contributions and support, hardening the party¡¯s resistance to any new gun laws. ? Carl Hulse, ¡°Why Republicans Won¡¯t Budge on Guns.¡± Yet while the power of the gun lobby, the outsize influence of rural states in the Senate and single-voter issues offer some explanation, there is another possibility: voters. When voters in four Democratic-leaning states got the opportunity to enact expanded gun or ammunition background checks into law, the overwhelming support suggested by national surveys was nowhere to be found. For Democrats, the story is both unsettling and familiar. Progressives have long been emboldened by national survey results that show overwhelming support for their policy priorities, only to find they don¡¯t necessarily translate to Washington legislation and to popularity on Election Day or beyond. President Biden¡¯s major policy initiatives are popular, for example, yet voters say he has not accomplished much and his approval ratings have sunk into the low 40s.The apparent progressive political majority in the polls might just be illusory. Public support for new gun restrictions tends to rise in the wake of mass shootings. There is already evidence that public support for stricter gun laws has surged again in the aftermath of the killings in Buffalo and Uvalde, Texas. While the public¡¯s support for new restrictions tends to subside thereafter, these shootings or another could still produce a lasting shift in public opinion. But the poor results for background checks suggest that public opinion may not be the unequivocal ally of gun control that the polling makes it seem. ? Nate Cohn, ¡°Voters Say They Want Gun Control.

https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/23/us/politics/democratic-convention-guns.html?searchResultPosition=48,2023-02-23,Georgia Gun Laws Weigh on Atlanta¡¯s Bid to Host 2024 Democratic Convention,"Boosters of Chicago¡¯s bid are raising safety questions about Georgia¡¯s lenient concealed-carry laws, jockeying for the upper hand as a decision nears. By Jonathan Weisman and Maya King CHICAGO ? The battle between Chicago and Atlanta over hosting the 2024 Democratic convention is heating up with a new claim from Illinois that Georgia¡¯s lenient open-carry gun laws ? already an issue with several public events in Atlanta ? could make security a nightmare. With a decision possibly weeks away, officials involved agree that Atlanta and Chicago now appear to lead New York, the third of the finalists still under consideration. Union officials have for weeks pressed President Biden and the Democratic National Committee to pick the more union-friendly city; Chicago has 45 unionized hotels while Atlanta has just two, they say. But recent events have brought a new argument: Georgia¡¯s lenient gun laws could make it extremely difficult to keep firearms away from the delegates. The Secret Service is likely to declare the convention a ¡°national security special event¡± and supersede state ordinances with its own rules inside a fortified perimeter. But in hotels, along bus routes and at meetings and parties far from the core convention sites, guns could find their way in, security consultants are warning, especially if Georgia¡¯s Republican governor, Brian Kemp, holds to his pro-gun views and refuses to intervene. ¡°It just creates a tense environment,¡± said Charles H. Ramsey, who once led police forces in Washington and Philadelphia and now does security consulting. ¡°To me it¡¯s an issue.¡± Georgia Democrats have scoffed at the pitch. The State Farm Arena, which would be one of the main sites of the convention should Atlanta win the bid, has protocols in place that prohibit carrying a firearm, despite gun laws that ostensibly allow weapons into most public spaces. Doug Shipman, president of the Atlanta City Council, said in an interview that the city had hosted big events since the state passed its first open-carry law ? derided by opponents as the ¡°guns everywhere¡± bill ? in 2014. The city also had strong security relationships with federal, state and local law enforcement authorities, he added. But, more to the point, the political significance of hosting the convention in a swing state that Mr. Biden narrowly carried in 2020 may supersede logistical and policy hurdles like gun laws, abortion bans and union hotels, Atlanta boosters said. ¡°Atlanta offers an enormous amount of historical and current symbolism. It¡¯s obviously the home of the civil rights movement but also more recently the home of, you know, wins by Senators Ossoff and Warnock,¡± Mr. Shipman said, pointing to the narrow twin electoral victories of Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock in 2020, and Mr. Warnock¡¯s victory again last fall. ¡°I think there are a lot of different factors that go into that calculus. I¡¯m not sure that the gun laws are going to have any particular impact on the decision.¡± Gun laws are already affecting public events in Atlanta. In April 2022 Mr. Kemp signed a measure passed by the Republican-controlled General Assembly, allowing most Georgians to openly carry a rifle in public spaces without a permit. A few months later, the Midtown Music Festival canceled its annual event after organizers said they were at a loss on how to protect their expected 50,000 visitors. A week later, another event, the 404 Festival, also canceled its gathering over safety concerns. Then this month, the SweetWater Brewing Company pulled its SweetWater 420 Fest out of Centennial Olympic Park ? where the Democratic convention potentially would be ? and sharply scaled back the event to hold it on the brewery grounds, a private space, citing the safety of festivalgoers. Security consultants said that the first open carry law might have been passed in 2014, but repeated mass shootings, the end of permit requirements and the surge of gun violence since 2020 have made insurers take notice and raise the costs of covering large public events. If nothing else, such headlines are allowing Chicago boosters to spotlight their city¡¯s tough gun control laws and Illinois¡¯s newly enacted, far-reaching ban on high-powered guns and high-capacity magazines. Though full adoption of the law is held up in court, its existence is part of an expansive pitch, including a constitutionally enshrined right to unionize and abortion rights protections, that Chicago is more in step with the party¡¯s values. Union leaders, who had been pressing their case against Atlanta privately, are also speaking up louder, saying that for many state delegations and union officials, staying in unionized hotels and attending events at unionized venues matter. Some union leaders said they had remained quiet when then-President Barack Obama chose Charlotte, N.C., for the 2012 convention. This time, they won¡¯t. ¡°Joe Biden is the most pro-union president in history, and having it in a pro-union town reinforces that record and sends a message,¡± said Ross Templeton, political and legislative director of the International Association of Iron Workers.

By Michael D. Shear MONTEREY PARK, Calif. ? In the nearly nine months since President Biden signed into law a series of gun safety measures last summer, scores of Americans have been killed or wounded in mass shootings across the country: in the Illinois suburbs, at a Virginia university, in an L.G.B.T.Q. nightclub in Colorado, and at a?dance studio in this Los Angeles suburb. Throughout that time, Mr. Biden has vowed to seek passage of a new ban on assault weapons ¡°come hell or high water.¡± But the president and his aides have acknowledged there is virtually no chance of that happening in a Congress that remains deeply divided over how to confront the slaughter of its citizens in repeated spasms of gun-related violence. So Mr. Biden traveled on Tuesday to Monterey Park, where a gunman killed 11 people in January during Lunar New Year festivities at the?Star Ballroom Dance Studio, to announce a handful of steps designed to improve enforcement of existing laws that have so far failed to prevent mass shootings in one American community after another. ¡°Today, I¡¯m announcing another executive order that will accelerate and intensify this work to save lives,¡± Mr. Biden told a small audience in Monterey Park that included family members and victims of the shooting, which terrorized the Asian American community here. ¡°It¡¯s just common sense,¡± the president said during the event, which had the somber tone of a memorial to those who died. ¡°Check whether someone is a violent felon, a domestic abuser, before they buy a gun.¡± Mr. Biden, who spent time meeting privately with relatives of the shooting victims, during his public remarks offered a somber recounting ? one by one ? of the 11 people who were killed on ¡°a day of festivity and light turned into a day of fear and darkness.¡± One had an ¡°infectious smile,¡± the president noted. Another exuded ¡°kindness, sweetness and generosity.¡± A third was ¡°a lifelong learner.¡± The visit, and the announcement of a new executive order, is Mr. Biden¡¯s latest attempt to express his horror over the continued loss of life and to demonstrate his administration¡¯s effort to reduce the chance of another mass shooting. But the president is constrained by the Second Amendment and a political system that has so far refused to make progress on his demands for universal background checks for gun sales, a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines and the repeal of immunity from liability for gun manufacturers. He repeated the assault weapons demand on Tuesday, noting that he had advanced the effort in the Senate in 1993 to pass a ban, which expired amid political disagreement a decade later. ¡°None of this absolves Congress from the responsibility of acting,¡± he said, his voice rising. ¡°Let¡¯s finish the job. Ban assault weapons. Ban them again. Do it now. Enough. Do something. Do something big.¡± Mr. Biden¡¯s new executive order is far more modest than that kind of lofty ambition. It directs the attorney general to make sure gun dealers are complying with existing background check laws. It seeks to improve reporting of guns and ammunition that are lost or stolen while in transit. It calls for better transparency about gun dealers who are cited for firearms violations. And it directs agencies to work with the National Integrated Ballistics Information Network to improve the quality of investigations into gun crimes. Some gun control advocates praised Mr. Biden for the new order. John Feinblatt, the president of Everytown for Gun Safety, said the effort to crack down on gun dealers ¡°will significantly expand background checks on gun sales, keep weapons out of the hands of dangerous people and save lives.¡± But few advocates think the steps will bring an end to the country¡¯s routine gun violence. Jose Sanchez, the mayor of Monterey Park, said he is optimistic that the United States will eventually make bigger changes to seriously confront what he called an ¡°addiction¡± to guns and gun violence in the country. He praised Mr. Biden for signing the new executive order. But he said it is not enough. ¡°I don¡¯t want in any way to offend the president,¡± Mr. Sanchez said. ¡°Because I think he¡¯s heading in the right direction. I think he¡¯s listening to what we need. But if I were to advise him, and if I were to be able to sit down with him, I would tell him that after he gets himself re-elected, that he needs to focus his next four years on making some serious changes.¡± On Tuesday, Mr. Biden said he would continue to call on Congress to act. ¡°In the meantime, my administration will continue to do all that we can, within existing authority, to make our communities safer,¡± he said in the preamble to the executive order. That message is likely to play a central role in Mr. Biden¡¯s expected re-election campaign, as he seeks to win the support of voters who believe the government should do more to limit gun violence. The president and his aides are keenly aware of the need to make sure those voters see him trying ? even if shootings continue. Mr. Biden has hailed the gun legislation that passed last summer as one of the few examples of bipartisan cooperation. Congress passed the measure after shootings at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, and a supermarket in Buffalo. Tuesday¡¯s executive order is primarily an effort to make sure federal agencies are putting last year¡¯s law into practice. David Hogg, a co-founder of March for Our Lives and a survivor of the 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., said in a statement that he was pleased to see Mr. Biden taking action. ¡°In poll after poll, gun safety is a winning issue in elections,¡± Mr. Hogg wrote. ¡°Americans and young people don¡¯t care about excuses. We care about results.¡± Mr. Hogg predicted that action on gun safety would ¡°win the youth vote in 2024.¡± Whether that ends up being true could depend in part on whether the actions Mr. Biden announced are seen as playing a role in preventing at least some of the mass shootings that would have occurred without them. And it will depend on how aggressively gun rights advocates fight back. Several groups issued statements on Tuesday vowing to do just that. ¡°Our elected leaders should be supporting those law-abiding Americans instead of finding more ways to hinder their right to defend themselves,¡± said Katie Pointer Baney, the managing director of government affairs for the U.S. Concealed Carry Association. Mr. Sanchez, the mayor of Monterey Park, said he remains optimistic because he has constituents ? and his own children ? who need hope. But he said he should not have had to hear his daughter describe the active shooter drill she practiced in kindergarten class. He urged Mr. Biden to fight what he called ¡°this disease, this addiction to guns¡± with as much vigor as he fought the Covid pandemic. ¡°I just feel that we cannot continue this way, where the major cause of death for young kids is gun violence,¡± he said. ¡°That¡¯s just inhumane.¡± Michael D. Shear is a veteran White House correspondent and two-time Pulitzer Prize winner who was a member of team that won the Public Service Medal for Covid coverage in 2020.

https://www.nytimes.com/article/what-are-ghost-guns.html?searchResultPosition=50,2023-08-08,¡®Ghost Guns¡¯: What They Are and Why There¡¯s a Fight Over Them,"A rule regulating the firearm kits was a centerpiece of President Biden¡¯s gun control initiative. The Supreme Court has temporarily revived it, but it has been troubled by significant challenges. By Annie Karni and Chris Cameron The Supreme Court has revived, at least for now, the Biden administration¡¯s regulation of ¡°ghost guns,¡± drawing a spotlight to the kits that can be assembled into homemade firearms and the new front in the fight over gun control that they have opened up. Administration officials say the popularity of the weapons has soared in recent years, particularly among criminals barred from buying ordinary guns. The regulation, issued in 2022 by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, broadened the bureau¡¯s interpretation of the definition of ¡°firearm¡± in the Gun Control Act of 1968. It did not ban the sale or possession of parts that can be assembled to make homemade guns, but it did require manufacturers and sellers to obtain licenses, mark their products with serial numbers and conduct background checks. The rule was a centerpiece of President Biden¡¯s broader initiative to address the proliferation of illegal weapons. Mr. Biden said last year that the rule would ¡°help save lives, reduce crime and get more criminals off the streets.¡± But the federal effort to regulate ghost guns has been troubled by uneven enforcement, significant loopholes and ongoing court challenges. A lower court judge had struck down the regulation, but the Supreme Court said it could remain in place while a challenge moves forward. Here¡¯s what you need to know about the weapons. Traditional firearms are made by licensed companies and then bought from licensed gun dealers. All guns manufactured in the United States, as well as those imported from abroad, are legally required to have serial numbers that are typically displayed on the back of the frame. In contrast, a ghost gun is sold in parts, and can be assembled at the home of an unlicensed buyer. Before federal regulations were put in place under the Biden administration, there was no need to pass a background check to obtain the components of a ghost gun. They are sold online as D.I.Y. kits, and typically shipped as ¡°80 percent receivers.¡± That means the gun is 80 percent complete, and buyers have to assemble the final 20 percent themselves. The key selling point for many buyers was that ghost guns were not required to have serial numbers, the critical piece of information that law enforcement agencies use to trace the gun from the manufacturer to the gun dealer to the original buyer.  It¡¯s easy and relatively inexpensive. According to a report by Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun violence prevention organization, an AR-15 build kit costs as little as $345. The sales pitches usually promise little work for the buyer. One online purveyor assured that ¡°building time doesn¡¯t take too long,¡± adding, ¡°Within an hour or two, you should be breaking it in at the range.¡± The kits usually come with directions on how to finish the gun or link to YouTube tutorials. Typically, the only tool needed is a drill, and the kits are often sold with the necessary drill bits. Many ghost guns are also sold with a ¡°jig,¡± which fits around the frame or receiver to make assembly easier. One site said the jig could be used to complete a gun ¡°in under 15 minutes with excellent results.¡± According to Everytown for Gun Safety, the top five instructional videos on YouTube for building a ghost gun have drawn more than three million views. Ghost guns aren¡¯t new, but they are a growing problem. Even though kits to assemble guns have been sold since the 1990s, the market did not really take off until around 2009. That is when firearm sellers in California began offering unfinished receivers for the AR-15 and AK-47 series of guns, in an attempt to circumvent the state¡¯s assault weapons laws, according to T. Christian Heyne, the vice president for policy at Brady, a gun violence prevention organization. The problem of ghost guns did not become well known until 2013, when one was linked to a rampage by a gunman who killed five people in the vicinity of Santa Monica College in California. Sales of ghost guns started to rise substantially around 2016, as people began buying kits to re-create a firearm based on the Glock 9-millimeter semiautomatic pistol. There is no way to know how many ghost guns were in circulation before last year¡¯s rule, because of the lack of requirements for serial numbers or a background check. But data shows that prevalence of the weapons appears to be growing every year, especially in coastal blue states with strict firearm laws like California. Law enforcement officials in the state said ghost guns accounted for 25 to 50 percent of firearms recovered at crime scenes in an 18-month period from 2020 to 2021, and the vast majority of suspects caught with them were legally prohibited from having guns. In 2021, the Justice Department reported that law enforcement agencies had recovered 19,300 homemade guns, about five times the number confiscated or found at crime scenes in 2018. Proponents of stricter gun laws have been pushing for action on ghost guns to address the problem before it reaches epidemic proportions. Opponents have questioned the data showing their growth. Some other mass shootings have been linked to ghost guns, like a 2019 incident at a high school in California where a 16-year-old killed two students. A ghost gun was also linked to a 2017 rampage in which a man killed his wife and four others in Northern California. But analysts said ghost guns were not disproportionately linked to mass shootings. The bigger issue is that they have an outsized effect on day-to-day gun violence in communities of color across the country, gun safety groups said. There are significant limits to how much Mr. Biden can do through executive action to regulate ghost guns. Officials and gun control groups have previously said that the regulation had done little to stop the sale of key parts used to make ghost guns, in part because the rule was created through executive action, rather than a statute validated by Congress. The Biden administration has since moved to close a major loophole in the rule by directing vendors to label some partially finished handguns with serial numbers, and to require that buyers of these parts undergo criminal background checks. Democrats have pushed the A.T.F. to more aggressively enforce the rule, but officials have cautioned that pushing too far could jeopardize the rule entirely by opening it to more court challenges. The powerful gun lobby has strongly opposed the rule, and several conservative legal groups have already challenged it, arguing that it violates existing firearms laws and Second Amendment protections.

A cheerleader mistaking another car for her own. Small errors can have large consequences in a nation bristling with guns. By Jack Healy,?Glenn Thrush,?Eliza Fawcett and Susan C. Beachy For more audio journalism and storytelling, download New York Times Audio, a new iOS app available for news subscribers. The maintenance man in North Carolina had just arrived to fix damage from a leak. The teenager in Georgia was only looking for his girlfriend¡¯s apartment. The cheerleader in Texas simply wanted to find her car in a dark parking lot after practice. Each of them accidentally went to the wrong address or opened the wrong door ? and each was shot. They had made innocent mistakes that became examples of the kind of deadly errors that can occur in a country bristling with guns, anger and paranoia, and where most states have empowered gun owners with new self-defense laws. This week, the issue of ¡°wrong address¡± shootings stirred protests and widespread outrage after a homeowner in Kansas City, Mo., shot a 16-year-old who rang the wrong doorbell. Days later, a 20-year-old woman in upstate New York was fatally shot after she and her friends turned into the wrong driveway. And then two cheerleaders in Texas were shot after one got into the wrong car in a dark parking lot. But many other cases have attracted far less attention. In July 2021, a Tennessee man was charged with brandishing a handgun and firing it after two cable-company workers mistakenly crossed onto his land. Last June, a Virginia man was arrested after the authorities say he shot at three lost teenage siblings who had accidentally pulled onto his property. ¡°It¡¯s shoot first, ask questions later,¡± said Justin Diepenbrock, who lives in Polk County, Fla., where the authorities say a father and son searching for what they thought was a burglar opened fire last year on a woman parking her car after working an overnight shift. The catalyst? The neighbors charged in the shooting had spotted Mr. Diepenbrock?on a doorbell camera leaving mistakenly delivered medication at their front door, according to court records. No precise figures are available, but these shootings are relatively uncommon in a country with nearly 49,000 gun deaths in a year. But gun-control advocates say they are a stark illustration of how quickly America reaches for guns ? and how tragic the results can be. Each one of these incidents resulted from unique events. But activists and researchers say they stem from a convergence of bigger factors ? increased fear of crime and an attendant surge in gun ownership, increasingly extreme political messaging on firearms, fearmongering in the media and marketing campaigns by the gun industry that portray the suburban front door as a fortified barrier against a violent world. ¡°The gun lobby markets firearms as something you need to defend yourself ? hammers in search of nails,¡± said Jonathan Lowy, a lawyer and gun-violence activist who has sued gun manufacturers on behalf of the victims of mass shootings and their families. National gun-rights groups remained relatively silent after the shooting in Kansas City, Mo., and many Republicans broadly supported the prosecutor¡¯s decision to bring charges. When a reporter asked him about the case, Senator Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican and outspoken defender of ¡°stand your ground¡± laws, which allow people to use deadly force in confrontations, expressed support for prosecutors. He then quickly pivoted to the theme of lawlessness in big cities. ¡°I don¡¯t think the problem is law-abiding gun owners,¡± Mr. Hawley said. ¡°I think the problem is criminals who go and shoot people.¡± The perception that crime, especially violent gun crime, has increased is not a manufactured myth. National murder rates have climbed by about a third since 2019, according to government data, even accounting for modest declines in fatal shootings over the past 18 months. And some property crimes that declined or plateaued during the coronavirus pandemic have shot back up in recent months, tracking closely with the rise in inflation: Thefts and robberies in major cities increased by around 20 percent in the first half of 2022, after declining the previous two years, the Council on Criminal Justice found. Gun purchases rose during the pandemic and the unrest and racial-justice protests after the murder of George Floyd. Nearly 20 percent of American households bought a gun from March 2020 to March 2022, and about 5 percent of Americans bought a gun for the first time, according to a survey from NORC at the University of Chicago. At the same time, Republican states including Florida and Texas passed new laws allowing people to carry guns openly, or carry concealed weapons without a permit. More than 30 states also have ¡°stand your ground¡± laws. Some have recently strengthened their ¡°castle doctrine¡± laws, making it more difficult to prosecute homeowners who claim self-defense in a shooting. ¡°People become paranoid and over-worried ? and then comes an unannounced knock on their door,¡± said Mr. Lowy, founder of Global Action on Gun Violence, a gun-control group based in Washington. Byron Castillo, 51, knows what it¡¯s like to be the one making that unannounced knock. On the morning of Jan. 30, 2020, Mr. Castillo said he was sent to a second-floor apartment in High Point, N.C., to repair and repaint damage from a leaking kitchen. He announced himself as the maintenance man and knocked three times. The tenant inside responded by opening the door and shooting Mr. Castillo in the stomach without a word of warning, he said. He dragged himself to his truck and drove to the apartment complex office, where he collapsed on the floor to wait for an ambulance. He spent one month in the hospital and another five months recovering on his couch, trying to rebuild strength in his legs and cope with the pain in his chest, where surgeons had cut him open. Mr. Castillo said he later learned that the repair job had been in a first-floor apartment. The High Point Police Department said prosecutors declined to bring charges. In a 2020 statement reported by local news outlets, the police said that ¡°through unfortunate circumstances, Mr. Castillo attempted to gain entry mistakenly into the wrong apartment,¡± and that the man who shot him thought he was a burglar. Mr. Castillo still cannot believe it. ¡°I was with my brushes and rollers in my hand,¡± he said. ¡°How would it be a threat for you? To kill you with a brush?¡± More than three years later, Mr. Castillo is still making minimum weekly payments of $30 on his hospital bills, and still feels pressure in his chest along his surgical scar. On every new painting or repair job, he says he walks through empty houses shouting his arrival and checking each room to make sure nobody is waiting with a gun. Prosecutors have brought charges in several of the ¡°wrong address¡± shootings that have made news in recent years, in part because the victims clearly had no intention of provoking a conflict. Kevin Monahan, 65, the upstate New York homeowner accused of killing Kaylin Gillis, has been charged with murder. Andrew Lester, the 84-year-old white homeowner in Kansas City, Mo., accused of wounding Ralph Yarl, who is Black, has been charged with assault and armed criminal action; the prosecutor said there was a ¡°racial component¡± to the shooting. The effect of self-defense laws protecting homeowners and gun owners is fiercely debated, with proponents arguing that their mere presence deters criminal behavior or civil disorder. Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, a Republican, recently invoked the state¡¯s ¡°stand your ground¡± law in asking the state pardon board to reverse the conviction of a man who claimed he killed a Black Lives Matter protester in 2020 because he felt threatened. But several large-scale studies have suggested that the laws have few benefits, increase the likelihood of gun violence and might discriminate against minority groups, especially Black people. According to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which supports gun control, shootings in which white people shot Black people were nearly three times as likely to be found ¡°justified¡± compared with cases where white people shot other white people. A 2023 analysis of recent academic research by the nonpartisan RAND Corporation found no evidence that such laws had the deterrent effect that their sponsors claimed, and there was some indication, while not conclusive, that the laws might account for some increases in gun violence. There are no reliable local or national statistics for the use of firearms in self-defense, and?the Harvard Injury Control Research Center, which studies crime data, found that weapons were actually more likely to be used in suicides, discharged accidentally, stolen or brandished in domestic disputes, than used to fend off an external attack. The National Rifle Association and other gun-rights groups have long disputed such assessments, citing surveys that show far greater use of weapons for legitimate self-defense. About a third of the roughly 16,700 gun owners surveyed in a study led by William English, a Georgetown University business school professor, said they had used their guns for self-defense, prompting Mr. English to estimate that as many as 1.6 million people in the country had defended themselves with a weapon that year. In Atlanta, the parents of 19-year-old Omarian Banks said their son posed no threat on the March 2019 night that he was shot at the wrong apartment door. It was past midnight, and Mr. Banks was tired after a shift at McDonald¡¯s, his parents said. So when he was dropped off at his girlfriend¡¯s apartment complex where every building looks nearly identical, he accidentally walked up to the wrong door and started knocking. Mr. Banks tried to apologize for his mistake, but, according to the police and Mr. Banks¡¯s girlfriend, the tenant inside the apartment, Darryl I. Bynes, told Mr. Banks, ¡°Nah, you¡¯re at the right house¡± and fatally shot Mr. Banks. Mr. Bynes, 32, is set to be tried for murder this summer. The family said Mr. Banks had hoped to one day work as an electrician alongside his father and younger brother. Instead, his mother and father said they had spent the past days reliving their trauma after seeing the news of another young man, this one in Kansas City, Mo., shot after showing up to the wrong address. ¡°When are they going to learn?¡± Lisa Johnson-Banks, Mr. Banks¡¯s mother, said. ¡°I know people have a right to protect their dwellings.

https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/25/us/politics/gun-control-atf-clyde-congress.html?searchResultPosition=52,2023-08-25,A Lawmaker Hid One Key Fact as He Fought Checks on Gun Shops,"One of two gun stores owned by Representative Andrew Clyde in Georgia, Clyde Armory in Athens, was placed in a monitoring program in 2020 and 2021. By Glenn Thrush Reporting from Washington Representative Andrew Clyde has been in Congress only since 2021, but he has quickly emerged as a vocal opponent of gun control, handing out dozens of AR-15 pins to exemplify his wide-ranging push to roll back federal firearms regulation. At a House Appropriations subcommittee hearing in April, Mr. Clyde, Republican of Georgia, grilled the director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, Steven M. Dettelbach, about a little-known program to monitor gun dealers found selling large numbers of weapons later traced to crimes. Mr. Clyde suggested the program, known as Demand 2, was unfair, questioned whether all crimes linked to such guns were ¡°bona fide,¡± and exhibited a detailed knowledge of its inner workings ? even though it applies to only a tiny percentage of gun dealers nationwide. What Mr. Clyde did not disclose was that one of two gun stores he owns in Georgia, Clyde Armory in Athens, was placed in the monitoring program in 2020 and 2021, according to records obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request by the gun safety group Brady. A.T.F. inspectors made the designation after they found that more than 25 guns sold there had been used in crimes within three years of their purchase. It is not clear what crimes were traced to guns sold through Mr. Clyde¡¯s stores, or whether his businesses have been cited for violations that could be used to revoke their licenses. Restrictions on releasing information about federally licensed dealers, imposed by Republicans at the urging of the National Rifle Association, prevent the A.T.F. from publicly disclosing most information about traces. But the agency regards a Demand 2 designation as an important indication that a seller might be a popular destination for criminals or the target of so-called straw purchasers who use surrogates to buy guns, according to current and former law enforcement officials. The time element is critical. Guns traced to crimes within three years of their purchase are considered weapons that have a brief ¡°time to crime,¡± a serious warning sign. ¡°The program is intended to put a small percentage of dealers, who are selling a significant number of guns with a short time-to-crime, on notice,¡± said Joshua Scharff, legal counsel for Brady. ¡°It¡¯s also an important way to more easily trace a greater number of guns that might be used in crimes.¡± Dealers assigned to the program are required to file detailed annual and quarterly reports on pre-owned guns sold to them by nonlicensed dealers or through consignments. Only 3 percent of the roughly 80,000 stores, manufacturers and pawn shops licensed by the federal government are currently enrolled in the program, according to A.T.F. statistics compiled by Brady. Mr. Clyde¡¯s office did not comment on the current status of his business, and did not say why he did not disclose that he had a personal interest in the program when he criticized it publicly. In an emailed statement, the congressman reiterated his criticism of the agency¡¯s use of crime tracing data to single out individual sellers, known as Federal Firearms Licensees, or F.F.L.s. ¡°Firearm traces cause a significant administrative burden for every F.F.L., and so should rightly be reserved only for open criminal investigations,¡± he said. ¡°Yet in reviewing the trace codes provided by the A.T.F., tens of thousands of traces appear to have nothing to do with an open criminal investigation.¡± An A.T.F. spokeswoman declined to comment. But Mr. Dettelbach, in his exchange with Mr. Clyde at the hearing this spring, pointed out that the vast majority of crime data used by the bureau was provided by local law enforcement agencies ? and that the bureau trusts their judgment in determining which crimes they consider to be serious. A Demand 2 designation is not, in itself, an indication of bad business practices or criminality. Big gun shops and chain sporting good stores often end up selling large numbers of guns traced to crimes through the sheer volume of weapons they sell, even when they have adequate safeguards. Mr. Clyde, a 28-year Navy veteran whose business generates about $12 million in annual revenue, has sponsored or supported nearly every effort by House Republicans to eliminate gun control measures and block the Biden administration from imposing new ones. A few weeks after the hearing, the House Appropriations Committee, of which Mr. Clyde is a member, proposed withholding funding for the program until it substantially weakened the criteria for placing dealers in Demand 2. He also sponsored resolution to stop the A.T.F. from enacting a regulation that requires owners of so-called stabilizing braces, which make it easier to fire semiautomatic pistols, to apply for a permit and pay a registration fee. Mr. Clyde has also tried to block requirements that licensed firearm dealers in states bordering Mexico report multiple sales of semiautomatic rifles, attempted to scuttle tightened regulation of untraceable ¡°ghost guns¡± and helped sponsor a bill to make the ¡°AR-15-style rifle¡± America¡¯s national gun. But he is probably best known for comments he made after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, in which he suggested that some of those who stormed the building behaved respectfully, as if they were on a ¡°normal tourist visit.¡± Those comments, which Mr. Clyde said were taken out of context, drew widespread condemnation from Democrats. But his actions that day suggested that he saw the danger. Photographs and videos show Mr. Clyde joining with lawmakers, staff members and police officers to barricade the main entrance doors of the House chamber with heavy wooden furniture as the rioters demanded to be let inside.

Initiatives on ballots in many states touch on some of the most divisive issues in the country, including abortion rights and gun restrictions. And a flurry of proposals reflect the disquiet that continues to endure after the 2020 presidential race, when former President Donald J. Trump took up efforts to overturn his loss and mobilize his supporters by spreading baseless claims of a stolen election. Republican-led initiatives are responding to those concerns, and supporters say they are needed to add security to the election process. But critics ? including President Biden ? contend that those proposals are part of a broader pursuit to thwart access to voting and weaken the country¡¯s elections systems, with Mr. Biden warning last week that ¡°American democracy is under attack.¡± In Arizona, where the Republican candidates for the U.S. Senate and governor have pushed to ban the use of electronic voting machines and dismantle the state¡¯s popular vote-by-mail system, one proposal would require photo identification if you¡¯re voting in person and an affidavit with birth date and driver¡¯s license number or the last four digits of your Social Security number if you¡¯re voting by mail. (Currently, to vote in person, a resident needs two pieces of documentation with name and address, like a phone bill or a vehicle registration.) Critics say efforts like these do not make the vote more secure and instead just create more hurdles. A similar debate is happening in Michigan, as voters consider an initiative, called Proposal 2, that would allow for nine days of early voting (the state currently has no polls open for that) and increase access to voting by absentee ballot. ¡°We must create a voting system that provides secure options for voters, equitable access to the polls and ensures all our voices are heard when it comes time to vote,¡± Khalilah Spencer, president of Promote the Vote, a group backing the effort, said as the campaign for Proposal 2 began this year. But Secure MI Vote, an opposing group, said, ¡°If Proposal 2 wins in November, elections will not be secure ever again.¡± An initiative in Ohio is aimed at thwarting any attempt to allow people who are not United States citizens from voting in local elections. It is meant to counter efforts elsewhere, including New York City, to allow permanent legal residents and people authorized to work in the United States to vote in city-level races. A similar proposal is up for a vote in Louisiana on a Dec. 10 ballot. Other measures offer an opportunity to take the nation¡¯s temperature on an array of other contentious issues. Several states, including California, Kentucky, Michigan and Vermont, have measures that will either protect or curtail abortion access. North Dakota, South Dakota, Missouri and Maryland have ballot measures on legalizing marijuana. In Colorado, which was one of the first states to legalize marijuana for recreational use, voters are deciding whether to decriminalize psychedelic mushrooms and allow for restricted access to people who are 21 and older. (Oregon is the only other state that has moved to widely legalize psychedelics.) In Iowa, an initiative proposes enshrining gun rights in an amendment to the state constitution that declares that residents¡¯ ability ¡°to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.¡± Oregon, however, could become one of the states with the tightest restrictions on guns as voters weigh a measure that would require people trying to obtain a permit to pass a background check, submit fingerprints, pay a fee and enroll in a safety course. Supporters argue that the measure could save lives by curtailing gun violence, but opponents contend that the proposal would not limit the effect of illegal firearms. Five states ? Alabama, Louisiana, Oregon, Tennessee and Vermont ? also have proposals on the ballot that would forbid slavery or involuntary servitude as a punishment for people who are convicted of crimes. (Similar measures were passed in Colorado in 2018 and Nebraska and Utah in 2020.) If it becomes banned, prisoners could challenge the practice of forced labor for which they are paid pennies per hour, if anything at all. A report published this year by the American Civil Liberties Union found that prisoners produced more than $2 billion in goods per year and provided more than $9 billion worth of services while being paid an average of 13 cents to 52 cents per hour. Alaska, Missouri and New Hampshire will also ask on ballots this year if residents want to convene a convention to revise or amend their state constitution ? a question automatically posed to residents at regular intervals, typically every 10 or 20 years, depending on the state. More broadly, many states are considering initiatives not just about access to the polls but the process by which elections are conducted. Nevada voters will decide whether to shift the state to a system of open primaries in which the five highest performing candidates advance to the general election, regardless of party. In Arkansas, there is a ballot initiative on ballot initiatives. The question before voters is to raise the requirement for statewide ballot initiatives to pass to 60 percent of the votes cast from a simple majority. Campaigns to mandate a supermajority have been pursued around the country in recent years ? and indeed for as long as ballot initiatives like these have existed ? as whichever party is in power sees them as a tool that can be used to undermine its influence. ¡°It cuts across partisanship because it¡¯s really about who controls state government,¡± said Daniel Smith, a professor of political science at the University of Florida. Comparable measures have had mixed results at the polls. In June, a proposal to require 60 percent support to pass a statewide initiative went on the ballot in South Dakota; 67 percent of voters said no. Advertisement",NYT

Why Don¡¯t They Stop More Mass Shootings?,"The state is still reeling from back-to-back attacks that left at least 19 people dead. The killings have spurred lawmakers to call for more regulations. By Shawn Hubler and Amy Harmon SACRAMENTO ? California bans guns for domestic violence offenders. It bans them for people deemed a danger to others or themselves. There is a ban on large-capacity magazines, and a ban on noise-muffling silencers. Semiautomatic guns of the sort colloquially known as ¡°assault weapons¡± are, famously, banned. More than 100 gun laws ? the most of any state ? are on the books in California. They have saved lives, policymakers say: Californians have among the lowest rates of gun death in the United States. Yet this month, those laws failed to stop the massacres of at least 19 people in back-to-back mass shootings. The tragedies in Monterey Park and Half Moon Bay have confounded Americans who regard California as a best-case bastion of gun safety in a nation awash with firearms. Inside the state, gun rights proponents say the shootings show that California¡¯s strategy is a failure. Gun safety groups, meanwhile, have already begun mobilizing for more laws and better enforcement. As details emerge in the investigations, numerous shortcomings have been highlighted, even with California¡¯s voluminous law. For instance, the state¡¯s regulatory net does not necessarily force gun owners to relinquish weapons that were legal for them to buy in the past but now are banned. California cannot remove guns from people who may have exhibited dangerous behavior, but aren¡¯t properly flagged to courts or law enforcement. And the state must contend with the illegal gun trade, a river of unregistered ¡°ghost¡± guns and the flow of firearms from neighboring states with less strict regulations. More broadly, however, the shootings are offering a lesson in the limits of state power to stop American gun violence, even with the political will at all levels of the state government to do so. Recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions have thrown key California laws into question, and the most recent shootings themselves have highlighted the difficulty of using state law to balance safety and liberty. ¡°I don¡¯t mean to sound forlorn, but I¡¯ve been watching this for decades and I¡¯m a gun control type guy, and I just see nothing coming out of it,¡± said Steve Wagstaffe, the district attorney in San Mateo County, where seven agricultural workers were fatally gunned down. ¡°California has had some good laws, but they¡¯re not as good as they could be.¡± The shooting in Monterey Park, in Southern California, left 11 people dead and eight wounded at a ballroom dance studio. Police said the suspect, 72-year-old Huu Can Tran, opened fire at a Lunar New Year party, then shot himself dead as officers approached the van in which he had fled. Two days later, sheriff¡¯s deputies in Half Moon Bay arrested 66-year-old Zhao Chunli hours after an explosion of workplace violence at two plant nurseries. Both accused gunmen had previous brushes with law enforcement. Both appeared to have been in the throes of a mental health crisis. And both had highly regulated weapons that cannot be acquired legally in California without numerous safeguards. Yet both slipped through the overlapping public safety and health regulations that California imposes to mitigate the risk of gun death. The weapon used by the gunman in Monterey Park ? a Cobray M-11/9 semiautomatic pistol outfitted with a 30-round magazine and what appeared to be a homemade silencer wrapped in duct tape ? is illegal to buy or sell in California. Manufactured in the 1970s and 1980s, the gun is an illegal ¡°assault weapon¡± under the state¡¯s definition, with an apparently threaded barrel, an illegal suppressor and the ability to accept a detachable magazine. Yet in 1999, authorities said, Mr. Tran purchased the weapon in Monterey Park. Sheriff Robert Luna of Los Angeles County did not specify how he acquired the gun, which licensed retailers stopped selling decades ago in California, but said it was not registered in the state. The sale, manufacture and import of high-capacity magazines also have been generally banned in California since 2000. But Mr. Tran¡¯s might have been legal, gun rights experts say, if he bought it before it was outlawed or during a weeklong window in 2019. The exception arose from a well-known critic of state gun laws, Judge Roger T. Benitez of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, a federal judge who once compared the AR-15 assault rifle, used in many mass shootings, to a Swiss army knife, in that both are ¡°a perfect combination of home defense weapon and homeland defense equipment.¡± Judge Benitez later stayed his own ruling, pending an appeal, that the state magazine ban violated the Second Amendment, but sales of large capacity magazines spiked in the state in the interim. California also requires extensive background checks to prevent the sale of guns to people who might harm themselves and others. People with felony convictions are barred from gun ownership for life, and even certain misdemeanor convictions can mean a decadelong ban. Sheriff Luna said Mr. Tran had been arrested in 1990 for unlawful possession of a firearm. It is unclear if he was ever convicted, and law enforcement officials are still examining how he was able to purchase his weapons. Gun law experts said California¡¯s laws would not have prevented Mr. Tran from legally buying a gun if he was not formally charged or convicted, or if he was convicted of a nonviolent misdemeanor and had completed his probation. In Half Moon Bay, a former roommate of the accused gunman had in 2013 successfully sought a temporary restraining order, alleging that Mr. Zhao had threatened to kill him and tried to suffocate him. Yet Mr. Zhao told authorities the Ruger semiautomatic he had used in Half Moon Bay had been legally purchased two years ago in California. Mr. Wagstaffe said investigators were still looking into where and how he acquired the gun. Restraining orders can disqualify a person from owning guns in California. But court records show the temporary order against Mr. Zhao was never made permanent, and it expired in July 2013. California also has a ¡°red flag¡± law that allows police, family members, employers, co-workers and others to petition a court for a gun violence restraining order to remove firearms from people who may be a threat to themselves or others. But those laws do not work if nobody uses them. The number of gun violence restraining orders issued in the state has risen to nearly 1,400 in 2021 from 85 in 2016. But that law is an underused resource, experts say. A 2021 study by the Violence Prevention Research Program at the University of California, Davis, found that although gun violence restraining orders had been available in California for five years, two-thirds of the Californians surveyed had never heard of them. Dr. Garen J. Wintemute, who directs the program, said many mass shooters signal their intentions in advance, or leave hints in their planning. At any point in time in California, he said, one in eight adults knows at least one person they believe is at risk of harming someone else or themselves, research shows. One model may be the city of San Diego, where the city attorney, Mara Elliott, has requested more than a thousand gun violence restraining orders since 2017. This month, the city requested and won the removal of a gun from an individual who threatened to kill people at a local hospital. ¡°I think most people second-guess their judgment. They think, ¡®I don¡¯t know who to call,¡¯ or ¡®I don¡¯t want to bother law enforcement, it¡¯s probably nothing,¡¯¡¯¡¯ Ms. Elliott said. ¡°Now our community knows to make phone calls.¡¯¡¯ Acquaintances and court records painted the Monterey Park suspect, Mr. Tran, as an embittered, paranoid and divorced loner. In Hemet, Calif., where he lived, police said he came to the station two weeks before the shooting to complain, without evidence, that he was the victim of fraud and theft and that his family had previously tried to poison him. In Half Moon Bay, Mr. Zhao told NBC Bay Area in a jailhouse interview that he ¡°was not in his right mind¡± and had felt mistreated for years at his workplace. Authorities confirmed a report that the accused gunman appeared to have snapped after a supervisor billed him $100 for a forklift accident.  But neither man appears to have alarmed anyone enough to seek a court order to take away their weapons. Neighbors and acquaintances said they did not know they were armed, suicidal or dangerous. Victims of mass shootings make up about 1 percent of overall gun deaths in the United States, according to federal gun homicide data analyzed by the advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety. The risk of dying in a mass shooting is even lower in California, the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California recently found. Nationally, suicides account for just over half of all gun deaths. But what mass casualty events lack in numbers, officials say, they often make up in fear and calls for political action. Last year, after mass shootings in Buffalo, N.Y., and Uvalde, Texas, California fast-tracked the passage of more than a dozen new gun laws. Gun rights advocates say more laws miss the point: Only a lawfully armed citizenry can ultimately ensure safety. Mass murders are already illegal, says Sam Paredes, executive director of Gun Owners of California. ¡°What do we want to do? Make them illegal-er?¡± But Jesse Gabriel, a Los Angeles-area Democrat in the state Assembly who co-chairs a legislative working group on gun violence prevention, said the group has already moved up its February meeting to discuss new legislation. Proposals include a state excise tax on ammunition and guns, a measure to add three years to an existing ban on gun ownership for people who have had domestic violence orders filed against them, a proposal to make the possession of an unregistered ¡°ghost¡± gun a felony and a bill to let people suffering a mental health crisis put their own names on a ¡°do not sell¡± list. A campaign to expand awareness of gun violence restraining orders also is underway. Also in the pipeline, he added, is a bill to align the state¡¯s laws on permits to carry concealed weapons in public with a sweeping June Supreme Court ruling that upended gun control laws in at least a half-dozen states, including California. Applauded by gun rights groups, the decision has unleashed a barrage of court challenges to California gun laws, including the bans on assault-style weapons and high-capacity magazines that are pending now before Judge Benitez. Rob Bonta, the California attorney general, said the concealed carry revision is essential, as are tighter gun regulations. ¡°Is there something new that hasn¡¯t been done?¡± Mr. Bonta said. ¡°That¡¯s what we¡¯re asking ourselves.¡± Adeel Hassan and Soumya Karlamangla contributed reporting.

By Glenn Thrush Reporting from Washington A federal appeals court ruled on Tuesday that a man who committed a nonviolent crime cannot be legally prevented from owning a firearm ? a potential setback to gun regulations spurred by a Supreme Court ruling last year that vastly expanded the right to bear arms. In an 11-to-4 ruling, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Philadelphia overturned court decisions against Bryan Range, a Pennsylvania resident who had sued the state after being blocked from buying a shotgun over a conviction for lying on a benefits application in the 1990s. In a majority opinion, Judge Thomas M. Hardiman repeatedly cited the Supreme Court ruling last June, written by Justice Clarence Thomas, in which the majority established a new standard that dictated that gun laws conform to ¡°historical tradition¡± dating to the 18th and 19th centuries. ¡°In sum, we reject the government¡¯s contention that only ¡®law-abiding, responsible citizens¡¯ are counted among ¡®the people¡¯ protected by the Second Amendment,¡± wrote Judge Hardiman, a George W. Bush appointee who was on President Donald J. Trump¡¯s short list to serve on the Supreme Court after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in 2016. It is unclear whether the ruling applies?to similar cases involving people who have committed low-level crimes, or whether it will have broader impact. Mr. Range¡¯s lawyer, Michael P. Gottlieb, said he had brought the case for the ¡°benefit of my client only¡± and said he believed it would make its way to the Supreme Court if the Justice Department is ¡°unwise enough to appeal.¡± A spokesman for the department did not immediately reply to a request for comment. The judges who sided with Mr. Range sought to play down the decision¡¯s significance. Judge Hardiman wrote that his opinion was narrow, pertaining only to cases involving nonviolent crime convictions with relatively lengthy potential prison sentences. Three judges concurring with the majority wrote that the decision ¡°does not spell doom¡± for a section of federal law that strips gun ownership from anyone ¡°convicted in any court of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.¡± Eric Tirschwell, the executive director of Everytown Law, a gun control organization that filed a brief supporting the lifetime gun ban on Mr. Range, also said that the decision was likely to have a limited impact. He cited an opposing decision last week by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in St. Louis reaffirming the government¡¯s right to deny guns to convicted felons. ¡°We expect that the vast majority of those convicted of felonies will continue to be prohibited from possessing firearms ? as another federal court of appeals ruled just days ago,¡± he said. But in a sharply worded dissent, Judge Patty Shwartz, an Obama appointee to the Third Circuit, predicted the majority opinion would set a broad and dangerous precedent. ¡°While my colleagues state that their opinion is narrow, the analytical framework they have applied to reach their conclusion renders most, if not all, felon bans unconstitutional,¡± she wrote. No matter the sweep of the ruling, Judge Hardiman¡¯s opinion directly addressed many of the core issues raised in the Supreme Court¡¯s decision last June, in expansive language that seemed to suggest that the constitutional foundation of many gun laws was eroding. The judge wrote that punishing Mr. Range by revoking his gun rights for an offense that did not involve violence gave lawmakers too much power ¡°to manipulate the Second Amendment¡± by labeling as a criminal?someone like Mr. Range, who led an otherwise law-abiding life. Under federal laws, people convicted of state or federal crimes that are punishable by more than a year in prison are barred from buying weapons. In some states, including Pennsylvania, such a ban takes effect after a conviction on a misdemeanor that has a potential sentence of at least a year. In his welfare fraud conviction, Mr. Range faced a maximum penalty of five years in prison but received probation. Judge Hardiman went on to argue that Justice Thomas¡¯s opinion for the majority in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen, had, essentially, flipped the script. The onus was no longer on Mr. Range to show why his gun rights should be restored, the judge said, but rather on the government, which now must justify what he described as its attempt to infringe on someone¡¯s Second Amendment rights. The case, which national groups on both sides of the firearms debate have been closely following, is the latest to join a?succession of federal court rulings that roll back existing gun regulations.  Among those waiting to see how broadly Tuesday¡¯s decision will be interpreted ? Hunter Biden and his legal team. Mr. Biden¡¯s lawyers have told Justice Department prosecutors, who are investigating whether to charge him in connection with lying about his drug use on a federal gun permit, that prosecution of him could be ruled moot by court decisions like the Range case, which was decided in the circuit court that includes Delaware. Christopher Clark, a lawyer for Mr. Biden, did not respond to a request for comment. Charlie Savage and Michael S. Schmidt contributed reporting. Glenn Thrush covers the Department of Justice.

https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/01/us/gun-laws-private-sales-background-checks-armslist.html?searchResultPosition=56,2023-08-01,"A Craigslist for Guns, With No Background Checks","A federal gun law passed last year gave the Biden administration a powerful new tool to increase background checks on ¡°private¡± firearms sales. Will the administration use it? By Serge F. Kovaleski and Glenn Thrush Another school week had just begun at Central Visual and Performing Arts High School in St. Louis when Orlando Harris, armed with a recently purchased AR-15-style rifle and 600 rounds of ammunition, burst into the building with a declaration: ¡°You are all going to die!¡± Mr. Harris, a 19-year-old graduate of the school, opened fire that morning in October, killing Alexzandria Bell, 15, and Jean Kuczka, a 61-year-old physical education teacher. More than half a dozen others were injured before the police fatally shot the gunman in a third-floor room where he had barricaded himself. Mr. Harris had struggled with mental health issues so severe that his family had him committed more than once, triggering an automatic rejection on the federal background check system when he tried to purchase a gun at a licensed dealer 16 days before the shooting. But Missouri is one of 29 states that have no background check requirement for private sales. So, Mr. Harris found a weapon by browsing the online site Armslist. Federal law requires background checks only for purchases made through the approximately 80,000 businesses that sell, ship, import or manufacture weapons licensed through the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Unlicensed private sellers, by contrast, can legally sell their wares at gun shows, out of their houses and, increasingly, through online platforms such as Armslist that match buyers with sellers. The growing digital loophole is causing alarm among gun-control advocates, and some of those whose relatives were targeted with powerful weapons purchased with relative ease online. ¡°It¡¯s not like selling a car radio,¡± Alexzandria¡¯s father, Andre Bell, said in an interview. ¡°It¡¯s a gun.¡± But the regulatory landscape might be changing. Senate Democrats, long blocked in their attempts to require universal background checks, negotiated a provision into the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, signed into law last year, that is expected to vastly increase the number of background checks in the unregulated gun market. The regulations required to put the new law into effect ? expected to be released soon ? would require anyone who earns a profit from selling firearms to obtain a federal license and conduct background checks. Previously, dealers were required to join the federal system only if they derived their chief livelihood from selling weapons. Failing to register carries a penalty of up to five years in prison and $250,000 in fines. The new measure is an attempt for the first time to regulate dealers such as Armslist, Florida Gun Trader and GunBroker.com, an online marketplace responsible for selling tens of thousands of guns in the United States every year. In March, President Biden included swift implementation of the provision in an executive order on gun policy. Senior officials from the Justice Department and the A.T.F. have been working closely with the White House to draft the regulations, targeting the second half of 2024. The regulations could set a threshold number of transactions that would define a dealer; gun-control groups hope to see it at five sales a year or lower. The rules will be backed up by a renewed push to prosecute businesses that refuse to register, by accessing bank records, storage unit leases and other expenses associated with running an off-the-books gun business. While the law does not include any explicit reference to online gun sales, legislators say it is their best chance to impose minimal safeguards on the rapidly growing percentage of sales that occur through internet retailers. ¡°Most people still think that the majority of unlicensed dealers are operating at gun shows, but that¡¯s really a pass? idea,¡± said Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat and longtime proponent of strict gun control. ¡°The real area of growth in firearms sales are online sales through sites likes Armslist.¡± Armslist, the best-known of the online gun-trading posts, was founded in 2007 by two college students from the Pittsburgh area looking to fill a market niche created when Craigslist banned firearms sales. From the start, the company¡¯s business model did not involve actually selling guns, but instead creating a virtual marketplace. Visitors are asked to attest that they are over 21, that they will indemnify the company for damages and that they will not use Armslist for ¡°any illegal purpose.¡± There is no specific mention of disqualifying factors under federal law, such as a criminal record, involuntary commitment to a mental institution, a history of domestic abuse or drug use. The site receives no cut from sales. Its founders initially intended to sell advertising, but the company has gradually switched from a free, ad-based platform to a pay-to-sell model based on premium memberships of $6.99 to $30 a month, referring on its website to ¡°the never-ending legal assaults on Armslist¡± that it says has made the site harder to keep afloat. One of those legal cases involved the family of a Chicago police commander, Paul Bauer, a 31-year veteran of the department. On the afternoon of Feb. 13, 2018, Mr. Bauer chased Shomari Legghette ? a felon described by his own lawyer as ¡°a long time drug dealer who routinely wore body armor and carried a gun to protect himself¡± ? into a stairwell. Mr. Legghette drew a 9-millimeter Glock and fired a fatal volley of bullets into the officer¡¯s head, neck and chest. The gun was traced to an Armslist post in 2017 and a prolific vendor on the platform: Thomas Caldwell, a military veteran from Wisconsin who, according to court documents, described his obsession with selling firearms as an ¡°addiction.¡± The Glock was one of 13 weapons sold by Mr. Caldwell that law enforcement authorities recovered at crime scenes. (The gun used to kill Mr. Bauer was initially sold to someone else and eventually found its way into Mr. Legghette¡¯s hands.) In September 2018, Mr. Caldwell pleaded guilty to engaging in the business of selling guns without a license ? one of a small number of such cases brought even before the change in the law ? and was sentenced to just over three years in prison. In an email, Mr. Caldwell did not address his own role but criticized the judge in his case, James D. Peterson, of the Federal District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin, for having what he viewed as an anti-gun bias. ¡°Hanging judge just didn¡¯t care as long as the left-wing radicals won,¡± he wrote. Numerous crimes have been linked to guns purchased through Armslist, among them the 2018 fatal shooting of a woman by her estranged husband near Appleton, Wis.; a 2012 mass shooting at a spa in Brookfield, Wis.; and the 2011 murder of a woman in the Chicago area. None of the purchasers underwent a background check. ¡°Imagine if the T.S.A. had two lines for security ? one where you are screened and one where you aren¡¯t,¡± said John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, which has pushed to close the private sales loophole. Many lawsuits targeting Armslist have been dismissed. Last month, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit upheld the prior dismissal of two suits ? one brought by Mr. Bauer¡¯s family ? in Wisconsin. The court found that Armslist was not liable because it was not an arms dealer, but a marketplace. Jonathan Gibbon, who runs Armslist, did not respond to requests for an interview. But he noted in a legal motion in 2019 that users of the site might have legitimate reasons for avoiding federally licensed dealers, including ¡°convenience¡± and the ¡°philosophical¡± issue of ¡°asking for governmental approval¡± to buy a gun. In a recent podcast, Mr. Gibbon urged his users ¡°to narc on actual criminals¡± they discovered on the site. A majority of weapons sold by unlicensed gun dealers never end up being used in crimes. Nobody knows for certain how many guns are sold outside the background check system. A 2015 survey of roughly 1,600 gun owners found that22 percent of gun owners self-reported that they had obtained firearms over the previous two years without being screened, as well as half of those who had purchased guns privately, somewhere other than a store or pawnshop. Many recent mass shootings have involved guns bought with background checks through federally licensed dealers. From 1966 to 2019, 77 percent of the suspects in mass shootings lawfully obtained some of their weapons, according to a survey compiled by the National Institute of Justice. And many unregulated sales still take place offline. Some are decidedly low-tech. In May, a federal jury in Pennsylvania convicted an Amish dairy farmer named Reuben King of engaging in the business of selling firearms without a license after he sold nine guns to undercover investigators. His sales floor was a barn on his property: Law enforcement authorities discovered around 600 long guns, many marked with price tags, arrayed on tables. His lawyer, Joshua G. Prince, said that Mr. King mostly sold to other Amish people who could not buy from licensed dealers because their faith precluded them from sitting for the photographs needed to obtain the requisite government-issued ID. Mr. Prince argued unsuccessfully that the government had not established a ¡°bright line¡± differentiating a casual trader from a profit-seeking dealer. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives brings a relatively small number of such cases each year. And even with the new changes to the law, prosecutors still have to prove that dealers willfully operated an illegal business, and they have been reluctant to seek indictments unless the evidence is overwhelming. One recent example: In 2021, agents served Armani Morris, an unlicensed gun dealer operating from a city south of Dallas, with a cease-and-desist letter. He read it, but said he did not want to sign it. In January, Mr. Morris pleaded guilty to running an illegal gun business and was sentenced to more than four years in prison after prosecutors presented evidence that he spent about $24,500 to purchase more than 50 firearms to resell for profit ? including a 9-millimeter pistol equipped with a mechanism that allows it to operate as a machine gun. Tom Chittum, a former top A.T.F. official, said there were ¡°risks to drawing bright lines¡± around the number of sales an unlicensed dealer could make, which might encourage illegal dealers to scatter sales through surrogates moving three or four guns a year. Others, including Senator Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat who drafted the provision in the 2022 law, are pressing the Biden administration to set a low, specific threshold. ¡°Everybody agrees those people should have to perform background checks,¡± he said. But laws are only as effective as their enforcement. What is remarkable about the school shooting in St. Louis is not just what went wrong, but what went right. On Oct. 8, about two weeks before he attacked the school, Mr. Harris was stopped from buying a gun at a licensed shop in St. Charles, just outside the city, the police said. Mr. Harris was listed in a prohibited category in the federal background check system: ¡°Adjudicated mental defective/committed to a mental institution.¡± His status was entered into the system in December 2021, according to three senior law enforcement officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. Mr. Harris¡¯s family had had him committed on occasion for mental health problems, the investigators said, one of the most common reasons for halting gun purchases during background checks. It was at this point that Mr. Harris turned to Armslist, according to two of the senior officials, where he arranged to buy a semiautomatic rifle; the seller was not required under Missouri law to screen him, and the person was cleared of any wrongdoing. A lawyer for Armslist did not comment on the incident. The authorities had one final opportunity to stop Mr. Harris. On Oct. 15, his mother, having discovered that her son had managed to obtain a gun, contacted the police. The officers who responded removed the weapon. But the police held onto it for only about 48 hours, one of the senior officials said. A police spokesman told reporters days after the shooting that the police had returned the gun to an unidentified adult known to the family who ¡°was lawfully able to possess it.¡± By that time, the police should have been aware that Mr. Harris was barred under federal law from buying or possessing a weapon. The F.B.I. had sent local authorities, including the police in St. Louis, a required notification that Mr. Harris had failed the federal background check, with a boilerplate recommendation that the police contact the A.T.F. if any further ¡°action¡± was required, according to law enforcement officials. Somehow, the rifle ended up in Mr. Harris¡¯s hands again. Following the attack, a Police Department spokesman said officers had returned the gun because they had no legal authority to even ¡°temporarily¡± confiscate it. Missouri has no ¡°red flag¡± law allowing relatives or law enforcement to seek a court order to prevent an individual experiencing a mental health crisis from accessing firearms. Missouri does prohibit people ¡°currently adjudged mentally incompetent¡± from possessing a gun. But it is unclear whether the police ? who recently declined to discuss details of the case, citing an ongoing investigation ? contemplated using that statute. Joe Kuczka, a son of the teacher killed in the shooting, said Mr. Harris¡¯s family had apparently ¡°tried to do the right thing.¡± ¡°They knew he had a mental health problem and tried to get the gun away from him,¡± he said. ¡°But it didn¡¯t work.¡± Adam Goldman contributed reporting.

By Shawn Hubler For more audio journalism and storytelling, download New York Times Audio, a new iOS app available for news subscribers. Saul Cornell¡¯s corner of academia has historically been sleepy. So few scholars share his specialty that the Fordham University professor jokes that he and his colleagues could hold a national convention ¡°in an English phone booth.¡± But in the months since a landmark Supreme Court decision upended the standards for determining the constitutionality of gun laws, Dr. Cornell has been booked solid. An authority on the history and laws around American weapons, he has served as an expert witness in at least 15 federal cases on gun control laws, which is roughly 14 requests more than he used to get in a busy year. Gun historians across the country are in demand like never before as lawyers must now comb through statutes drafted in the Colonial era and the early years of the Republic to litigate modern firearms restrictions. From experts on military gun stamping to scholars of American homicide through the ages, they have been called ? many for the first time ? to parse the nation¡¯s gun culture in court. Cases now explore weapons bans in early saloons, novelty air rifles on the Lewis and Clark expedition, concealed carry restrictions on bowie knives and 18th-century daggers known as ¡°Arkansas toothpicks,¡± and a string-operated ¡°trap gun¡± that may or may not be comparable to an AR-15 semiautomatic rifle. ¡°This is what the courts have unleashed upon us,¡± said Darrell A. H. Miller, a Duke University law professor and faculty co-director at the Duke Center for Firearms Law. ¡°Suddenly everyone is looking for early Republic scholars to tell them what the culture and norms around firearms law were in the 18th century.¡± In a 6-3 decision last June, the Supreme Court dramatically shifted the standard for firearm restrictions. Writing for the majority in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen, Justice Clarence Thomas found that gun laws should be judged not by the longstanding practice of balancing gun rights against the public interest, but according to the Second Amendment¡¯s text and the ¡°historical tradition¡± of gun regulation. The constitutionality of gun constraints, he suggested, would hinge on whether the government could show a ¡°historical analogue¡± in the law, either in 1791 when Americans ratified the right to bear arms, or around 1868, when the Fourteenth Amendment extended protections against federal infringements on gun rights to the states. That originalist view has been celebrated by gun rights advocates for strengthening a constitutional right and presenting a wide-open opportunity to erase gun control laws. Many others, seeking stricter controls against a crushing epidemic of gun violence, say that it is dangerous and absurd to base modern public safety on the 1700s and 1800s when a gun can be built with a 3-D printer and plans shared on the internet. Lawyers on both sides say it is unclear how Bruen will be interpreted in the long term; it seemed to leave some room to account for ¡°unprecedented¡± societal concerns, new technology and sensitive places, such as schools. In the near term, however, the decision has set off an explosion of legal challenges to gun laws and a scramble by government lawyers to find historically analogous regulations in centuries-old traditions and statutes. The stakes are high. In just the first 10 weeks of this year, there have been more than 100 mass shootings, and gunfire has claimed the lives of more than 8,100 people and injured more than 6,000, according to the Gun Violence Archive, a research group that tracks public reports. In West Virginia, a federal judge in October struck down a prohibition aimed at ¡°ghost guns¡± that are untraceable and often built through at-home kits because, in 1791, privately owned firearms were not required to have serial numbers. In Texas, another federal judge recently ruled that it was unconstitutional to take guns from domestic abusers in part because men who beat their wives rarely were prosecuted, let alone forced to relinquish their firearms, until the 1970s. The Bruen decision and subsequent federal rulings?have provided momentum to gun rights groups across the nation, particularly in Democratic-led states. ¡°We are going to defeat virtually every gun control on the books ? assault weapons bans, large capacity magazine bans, ammunition registration, rosters of approved handguns for sale, limitations on how many guns you can buy in a month,¡± Sam Paredes, the executive director of the Gun Owners of California, said. ¡°The courts have held that these laws don¡¯t have an analogous law to 1791 when the Second Amendment was written, so they are by definition unconstitutional.¡± Some judges have bristled at the new rules. In a Mississippi challenge to a law prohibiting felons from carrying firearms, U.S. District Judge Carlton W. Reeves last fall wrote in a blistering order, ¡°This Court is not a trained historian,¡± adding, ¡°And we are not experts in what white, wealthy, and male property owners thought about firearms regulation in 1791.¡± Judge Reeves wondered if the court should hire a neutral history consultant; both sides objected, preferring experts of their own. Other judges have demanded encyclopedic briefings. In California, a federal judge who is weighing challenges to several key gun laws ordered lawyers to draw up a compendium of laws on lethal arms from Colonial times through the post-Civil War era. The 56-page list submitted to U.S. District Court Judge Roger T. Benitez included dueling pistols, muskets, trick ¡°cane guns¡± and a custom-made instrument of mass murder known as ¡°the infernal machine.¡± Traffic on online archives is surging. Since the Bruen decision, views have risen to 1,000 per month, from 200 or 300, of a searchable repository of some 1,700 historical gun laws hosted by the Duke firearms law center, according to its executive director, Andrew Willinger. Demand has similarly boomed for scholars who can put gun technology and law into context, particularly among Democratic attorneys general defending restrictions. Jennifer Tucker, who directs the Center for the Study of Guns and Society at Wesleyan University, said lawyers have reached out to seek experts on topics as disparate as weapon restrictions on stage coaches and the contested history around an 18th-century attempt at an extended capacity firearm ? which supposedly would fire round bullets at Christians and square ones at ¡°heathens¡± ? known as the ¡°Puckle gun.¡± Robert J. Spitzer, a retired political science professor at SUNY Cortland who has written a half-dozen books on the history of gun rights, has consulted on at least 10 gun law cases. ¡°The typical image of every adult white male owning a gun, using it to defend hearth and home, the wild West being tamed by the Colt and the Winchester ? basically none of that stuff is true,¡± he said, adding that some of the first laws in Colonial America were gun controls. In Oregon, where gun rights groups are challenging controls passed by voters in November, the court file features dueling historians. For the plaintiffs, Ashley Hlebinsky, the former curator of the Cody Firearms Museum at the Buffalo Bill Center of the West in Wyoming. For the government, Brian DeLay, a historian at the University of California, Berkeley, and an expert in the history of early American arms. A highlight is the discussion of a novel, multishot air rifle that Meriwether Lewis and William Clark brought on their continental expedition. The plaintiffs mention the gun as an indication that high-capacity firearms were common, even in the early 1800s, and yet were unregulated by the nation¡¯s founders who presumably could have restricted them. But Dr. DeLay writes that commercially feasible guns capable of firing multiple rounds were far beyond the technological reach of the era, and that those in existence were little more than ¡°expensive curiosities¡± for collectors. Writing laws for them in 1791, he writes, would be like implementing regulations for ¡°personal jetpacks¡± today. Most of the scholars tapped by the states say they are both honored to serve and deeply unsettled. Some said they feared that partisan judges were co-opting history itself and larding the law with culture war myths and politically useful distortions; others that, in an anti-intellectual era, historians simply will be ignored. In a December hearing on the constitutionality of California¡¯s ban on large-capacity magazines, Judge Benitez ? an appointee of former President George W. Bush who has repeatedly ruled against gun restrictions ? said he saw no need for well-known historians. ¡°We¡¯re not looking for truffles,¡± the judge said, adding: ¡°The history and tradition is what it is.¡± And gun rights experts contend that history does not belong to academics alone. Ms. Hlebinsky said in an interview that gun collectors, in particular, have done ¡°a lot of research¡± that courts should consider, even though ¡°you don¡¯t have the peer review system within the academic university structures.¡± Her own neutrality recently was questioned in a Rhode Island gun law ruling by a federal judge who was appointed by a Democrat. ¡°I see a lot of scholarship that is nontraditional,¡± said Ms. Hlebinsky, who does not have a doctoral degree and who recently co-founded a firearms research center that she said was largely funded with donations from the firearms industry. How the law will ultimately view history remains to be seen. On Thursday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit in Atlanta cited 19th century laws to uphold a Florida age limit on gun purchases, rejecting a challenge by the National Rifle Association. But last month, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans struck down a Texas prohibition on guns for people who have domestic violence restraining orders against them. Adam Winkler, a University of California, Los Angeles, law professor who has written widely on gun rights, said that inconsistency in the way the appellate courts interpret history will likely force the Supreme Court to eventually clarify or revise the Bruen test, but the bar will be high for firearm restrictions. ¡°The fact of the matter is, a large number of our gun laws are 20th century inventions,¡± he said.

By Adam Liptak WASHINGTON ? The Supreme Court on Wednesday turned down a request from firearms dealers in New York to block parts of recent state laws that they said violated their Second Amendment rights. The court¡¯s brief, unsigned order gave no reasons, which is typical when the justices act on emergency applications. On Jan. 11, the court, also without comment, rejected a request to block other provisions of one of the laws at issue in the new case. The two orders suggest that the justices will not immediately elaborate on the scope of its landmark decision in June establishing that the Second Amendment protects, as Justice Clarence Thomas wrote for the majority, ¡°an individual¡¯s right to carry a handgun for self-defense outside the home.¡± That decision, New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen, struck down a New York law that required people seeking a license to carry a handgun in public to demonstrate that they had a ¡°proper cause.¡± State lawmakers promptly passed a new law that they said protected public safety while complying with the Supreme Court¡¯s decision. The firearms dealers in the new case, Gazzola v. Hochul, No. 22A591, filed a lawsuit in November challenging provisions of that law and an earlier one enacted in June, before the Bruen decision, saying they violated the Constitution and conflicted with federal law. Judge Brenda K. Sannes of the Federal District Court in Syracuse rejected the plaintiffs¡¯ request for a preliminary injunction, and a unanimous three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit refused to enter its own injunction while an appeal moved forward. The dealers then asked the Supreme Court to intervene. The challenged measures include ones requiring security systems at gun stores, barring people under 18 from entering them unless they are with a parent or guardian, requiring workers to be at least 21 and requiring background checks for sales of ammunition. In their own Supreme Court brief, state officials said that the Supreme Court has indicated that it did not intend to cast doubt on, in the words of Justice Antonin Scalia¡¯s majority opinion in 2008 in District of Columbia v. Heller, ¡°laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.¡± Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., repeated the point in a concurring opinion in June in the Bruen decision, the state¡¯s brief noted. ¡°Thus,¡± lawyers for the state wrote, ¡°this case does not involve any significant Second Amendment issue left open by Bruen that would warrant this court¡¯s review.¡± Adam Liptak covers the Supreme Court and writes Sidebar, a column on legal developments.

But Did He Break the Law?,"In states with permissive gun laws, police and prosecutors have limited tools at their disposal when a heavily armed individual sows fear or panic in public. By Richard Fausset  For more audio journalism and storytelling, download New York Times Audio, a new iOS app available for news subscribers. ATLANTA ? Two days after a gunman killed 10 people at a Colorado grocery store, leaving many Americans on high alert, Rico Marley was arrested as he emerged from the bathroom at a Publix supermarket in Atlanta. He was wearing body armor and carrying six loaded weapons ? four handguns in his jacket pockets, and in a guitar bag, a semiautomatic rifle and a 12-gauge shotgun. Moments earlier, an Instacart delivery driver had alerted a store employee after seeing Mr. Marley in the bathroom, along with the AR-15-style rifle, which was propped against a wall. A grand jury indictment later described what had come next: ¡°panic, terror and the evacuation of the Publix.¡± Mr. Marley, then 22, was arrested without incident that day in March 2021. His lawyer, Charles Brant, noted that he had not made any threats or fired any shots, and had legally purchased his guns. Mr. Marley did not violate Georgia law, Mr. Brant said; he was ¡°just being a person, doing what he had the right to do.¡± Indeed, Mr. Marley¡¯s arrest kicked off a long and as yet unresolved legal odyssey in which the criminal justice system waffled over what it could charge him with and whether to set him free. Clearly, visiting the grocery store with a trove of guns had frightened people. But was it illegal? The episode, and others like it, speaks to a uniquely American quandary: In states with permissive gun laws, the police and prosecutors have limited tools at their disposal when a heavily armed individual¡¯s mere presence in a public space sows fear or even panic. The question of how to handle such situations has been raised most often in recent years in the context of political protests, where the open display of weapons has led to concerns about intimidation, the squelching of free speech or worse. But it may become a more frequent subject of debate in the wake of a landmark Supreme Court decision in June, which expanded Americans¡¯ right to arm themselves in public while limiting states¡¯ ability to set their own regulations. The ruling also affirmed the principle of allowing states and local governments to ban guns in ¡°sensitive places¡±; as examples, it cited legislative assemblies, polling places and courthouses. But the high court left much open for interpretation. ¡°A wave of litigation is going to confront the courts with questions about what, for example, makes a restriction on guns in schools and government buildings different than in museums or on public transit,¡± Jacob D. Charles, a professor and gun law expert at Pepperdine Caruso School of Law, wrote in a recent blog post. Events like the one involving Mr. Marley, while difficult to quantify, are extreme examples of a problem already bedeviling the police and prosecutors, sometimes from the moment an armed person is spotted in public. All but three states allow for the open carry of handguns, long guns or both, and in many there is little the police can do. Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, a bipartisan law enforcement policy group, said police officers sometimes had mere seconds to determine whether a person with a gun ¡°either legally has the right or he¡¯s a madman¡± ? or both. ¡°For the average cop walking the street in America, it¡¯s a huge dilemma, knowing there have been countless active shooter situations,¡± Mr. Wexler said. Prosecutors initially went all in on Mr. Marley¡¯s case, charging him with 11 felonies: five counts of criminal attempt to commit a felony and six counts of possession of a weapon ¡°during commission of or attempt to commit certain felonies.¡± An arresting officer said in an affidavit that when Mr. Marley had put on his antiballistic armor in the Publix bathroom and placed the handguns, with rounds in the chambers, into his pockets, he had taken a ¡°substantial step of the crime of aggravated assault,¡± a felony. In July 2021, Judge Debbie-Ann Rickman of Fulton County Magistrate Court denied Mr. Marley bond, determining that he posed a ¡°significant danger to the community.¡± But court records show that the charges were dismissed in February. Mr. Marley was released from jail after 10 months, only to be rebooked in May, this time after being indicted by a grand jury on 10 lesser counts of reckless conduct, a misdemeanor. The indictment says that Mr. Marley was ¡°loading and displaying¡± his AR-15 in the restroom and that he left it unattended. He pleaded not guilty to the charges in August and remains in custody. (Mr. Brant, his lawyer, said he had not filed a new bond motion on his client¡¯s behalf because Mr. Marley was homeless and did not have family or friends to stay with.) John R. Monroe, a defense lawyer and the vice president of a gun-rights group called Georgia Second Amendment, is not involved in Mr. Marley¡¯s case. But from the outside, he said, it seems baseless. ¡°I mean, all the guy did was be in the store with guns,¡± he said. ¡°I go into Kroger with a gun, and I don¡¯t expect to be arrested for reckless conduct when I do that. Based on the information from the case, he didn¡¯t do anything that would even remotely constitute reckless conduct. And shame on the state for even prosecuting him for that.¡± Taking out the rifle in the men¡¯s room would have most likely violated the law in Illinois, Florida and California, where open carry is banned, Mr. Charles said. But states with more lenient gun laws have struggled with scenarios similar to the one involving Mr. Marley. In February, a man named Guido Herrera was discovered at the Galleria mall in Houston, a few yards from a youth dance competition, wearing a spiked leather mask and carrying a Bible and an AR-15-style rifle. An off-duty police officer working as a security guard was alerted to his presence and tackled him. Mr. Herrera was found to have more than 120 rounds of ammunition with him, as well as a semiautomatic handgun holstered in his waistband. He was charged with disorderly conduct, a misdemeanor that under Texas law includes knowingly displaying a firearm in public ¡°in a manner calculated to alarm.¡± A jury found him guilty, and he was given a six-month jail sentence. Prosecutors were openly frustrated. ¡°His circumstance kind of fell in the gaps,¡± Barbara Mousset, a lawyer with the Harris County District Attorney¡¯s office, said at Mr. Herrera¡¯s sentencing, according to The Houston Chronicle. ¡°He took advantage of some technicalities in the law ? he had the right to have that firearm and, ultimately, this was the only charge that we could get him on.¡± In an interview, Armen Merjanian, a lawyer for Mr. Herrera, called his client ¡°a proud owner of firearms living in Texas,¡± adding that Mr. Herrera brought the rifle into the mall because he was worried about it being stolen from his car. Nathan Beedle, the misdemeanor trial bureau chief in the Harris County prosecutor¡¯s office, pointed to the practical challenges of applying the legal standard. ¡°How long does it take to go from ¡®in a manner calculated to alarm¡¯ to deadly conduct?¡± said Mr. Beedle, who helped handle the Herrera case. ¡°A millisecond, right?¡± Not all such cases have ended peacefully. In 2015, a woman in Colorado Springs called 911 after seeing a man in her neighborhood with a gun. The dispatcher reportedly explained to her that Colorado was an open-carry state. Within minutes, the man went on a shooting spree, killing three people. Mr. Brant, the lawyer for Mr. Marley, said his client might suffer from mental illness and was awaiting a formal diagnosis. He said Mr. Marley had attempted suicide during his first, 10-month jail stint. Mr. Brant also offered an explanation for Mr. Marley¡¯s conduct that day: He had acquired the guns and the body armor, Mr. Brant said, because he had felt threatened by someone in his neighborhood. On the day of his arrest, he had hoped to take his guns to a nearby shooting range but first had to run some errands, which included a stop at the grocery store. (Mr. Marley did not have a car, Mr. Brant said, which is why he was carrying the guns around with him.) While in the Publix men¡¯s room, Mr. Brant said, Mr. Marley had taken out some of the weapons, including the rifle, to clean them after discovering that some guacamole he had bought had caused a mess inside the bag. Charles Russell, the Instacart driver who came upon Mr. Marley in the men¡¯s room, told police that, at one point, he had heard clicking sounds from a stall that ¡°sounded to him like someone was loading firearms,¡± according to a police report. In a recent interview, Mr. Russell, 27, said he had the Colorado massacre on his mind at the time. He recalled thinking, ¡°If I don¡¯t do anything, then I¡¯m afraid of what will happen.¡± In a statement to The New York Times, Fani T. Willis, the district attorney in Fulton County, which covers most of Atlanta, said her office had taken a hard look at the case but had not found ¡°provable felonies under Georgia law.¡± ¡°Georgia¡¯s General Assembly must examine our statutes governing this type of behavior,¡± added Ms. Willis, a Democrat, referring to the state¡¯s Republican-controlled legislature. ¡°Respecting the right to bear arms should not require that we tolerate people entering public places with assault rifles and body armor.¡± Mr. Brant said he did not believe anything Mr. Marley had done that day amounted to reckless conduct in a state that has been vigorously pushing the boundaries of the freedom to carry weapons in public. He alluded to a law signed by Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, more than a year after Mr. Marley¡¯s arrest that allows people to carry concealed handguns without a license. ¡°What is the definition of reckless conduct?¡± Mr. Brant said. ¡°Carrying weapons? In a state that requires no permit? And no license? I mean, help me understand, what¡¯s the reckless conduct?¡± Audio produced by Parin Behrooz. Richard Fausset is a correspondent based in Atlanta.

https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/28/us/politics/biden-guns-congress.html?searchResultPosition=60,2023-03-28,Biden Concedes He Is Powerless to Act on Guns Without Congress,"¡°I have gone the full extent of my executive authority to do, on my own, anything about guns,¡± President Biden said. By Michael D. Shear WASHINGTON ? President Biden on Tuesday declared himself powerless to respond to the scourge of gun violence in America, a remarkably blunt admission one day after an assailant killed six people, including three children, at a school in Nashville. ¡°I have gone the full extent of my executive authority to do, on my own, anything about guns,¡± Mr. Biden told reporters, responding to questions about what actions he could take to prevent mass shootings. It was a stark and surprising statement by the president, who essentially threw up his hands in the face of one of the most intractable problems facing American society. While the political system has remained all but deadlocked for more than a decade on major changes to gun laws ? despite one horrifying shooting after another ? Mr. Biden sought to shift the burden to the senators and representatives who have so far refused to act. Even with majorities in both houses of Congress during Mr. Biden¡¯s first two years in office, Democrats were unable to pass an assault weapons ban, and any effort now is almost certain to fail in the Republican-controlled House. Mr. Biden rejected questions about whether he could, or should, do more through executive actions, such as trying to keep guns out of the hands of criminals or addressing mental health issues that are often viewed as the cause of mass shootings. ¡°The Congress has to act,¡± Mr. Biden told reporters as he headed for an economic event at a North Carolina semiconductor plant. ¡°The majority of the American people think having assault weapons is bizarre; it¡¯s a crazy idea. They¡¯re against that. And so, I think the Congress should be passing the assault weapons ban.¡± To be clear, he said, ¡°I can¡¯t do anything except plead with the Congress to act reasonably.¡± Speaking later at the event in North Carolina, Mr. Biden did just that, urging Congress to ban assault weapons and saying that they should try to keep ¡°weapons of war¡± out of the hands of people who could use them to kill children and others. ¡°People say, ¡®Why do I keep saying this if it¡¯s not happening?¡¯¡± the president said. ¡°Because I want you to know who isn¡¯t doing it. Who isn¡¯t helping. To put pressure on them.¡± He added that there was ¡°a moral price to pay for inaction.¡± But there was no sign that congressional action was imminent ? far from it. On Tuesday, as Democrats renewed their calls for passing gun safety legislation, Republicans made it clear they were not willing to budge from their opposition to assault weapons bans and other aggressive measures. ¡°With respect to any discussion of legislation, it¡¯s premature,¡± said Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, citing an ¡°ongoing investigation¡± and the need to collect more facts. Other members of his party went further, seizing on the gender of the assailant, who authorities said identified as transgender, as a way to shift the conversation away from gun safety measures. Senator J.D. Vance, Republican of Ohio, said in a post on Twitter that the tragedy suggested that ¡°giving into these ideas¡± about accepting transgender people was ¡°dangerous.¡± Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, Republican of Georgia, highlighted questions about the shooter¡¯s gender identity, which she said meant that ¡°everyone can stop blaming guns now.¡± Quinton Lucas, the chairman of the criminal justice committee at the U.S. Conference of Mayors, said the president¡¯s comments echo the deep frustration among many Americans. ¡°It¡¯s not so much disappointing or surprising, perhaps, that the president says that,¡± said Mr. Lucas, who is the mayor of Kansas City, Mo. ¡°It¡¯s just telling of where we are right now in America that the president says that and each person just shakes their head and says, ¡®yeah, that¡¯s right.¡¯¡± Mr. Lucas said he and his colleagues often talk about how to manage school shootings ? making the assumption they are inevitable in their communities. ¡°I feel like we¡¯ve given up,¡± he said. Mark K. Updegrove, a presidential historian, said Mr. Biden¡¯s blunt comments about the limits of his power are not unlike the kind of private assessment that Lyndon Baines Johnson once gave to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in private about his lack of power to pass voting rights legislation. According to Mr. Updegrove, Mr. Johnson told Dr. King flatly in 1964 that he didn¡¯t have the power to get the bill through Congress. In Mr. Biden¡¯s case, the frank acknowledgment was public, not private. Mr. Updegrove said it struck him as a way for the president to put additional pressure on Congress. ¡°That¡¯s the right message to send,¡± said Mr. Updegrove, the president of the LBJ Foundation in Austin, Texas. ¡°¡®I¡¯m doing everything I can for gun reform. I¡¯ve already done the extent I can do. It¡¯s incumbent on Congress to act.¡¯¡± Mr. Biden reminded reporters on Tuesday that as a senator he led the successful effort in 1994 to pass a ban on assault weapons as a way to reduce the use of ¡°weapons of war¡± in shootings at schools, shopping malls and elsewhere. The ban stayed in place until Congress let it lapse 10 years later. Since then, however, Washington has refused to reinstate the ban, and has largely failed to pass significant new restrictions on the sale, manufacture or distribution of firearms. Modest bipartisan legislation passed last year, and signed into law by Mr. Biden, offered incentives to local governments to set up red flag laws and made minor changes to background check laws. The issue of what to do about gun violence in America has been a challenge for presidents for years. In 2012, President Barack Obama struggled to hold back tears as he reacted to the killing of 20 children at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn. Months later, he responded angrily when the Senate rejected his appeal for universal background checks on all gun sales. Mr. Obama called it a ¡°shameful day for Washington.¡± ¡°But this effort is not over,¡± Mr. Obama said, echoing the language of presidents before and after him. ¡°I want to make it clear to the American people we can still bring about meaningful changes that reduce gun violence, so long as the American people don¡¯t give up on it. Even without Congress, my administration will keep doing everything it can to protect more of our communities.¡± In 2018, after a shooting at a high school in Parkland, Fla., President Donald J. Trump convened a session broadcast on live television and declared: ¡°It would be so beautiful to have one bill that everyone could support. It¡¯s time that a president stepped up.¡± He later abandoned efforts to pass gun safety legislation in the face of lobbying by conservative lawmakers and the National Rifle Association. During his first two years in office, Mr. Biden has repeatedly promised to use executive power to make progress even as action in Congress remains stalled. This month in Monterey Park, Calif., the site of another mass shooting, Mr. Biden announced a series of executive actions directing administration officials to do everything possible ? without new congressional legislation ? to expand background checks and limit the spread of illegal guns. But he appeared to be concerned that members of Congress could use continued executive actions as an excuse to avoid taking actions of their own. ¡°Let¡¯s be clear,¡± Mr. Biden said during his remarks in Monterey Park. ¡°None of this absolves Congress from the responsibility of acting to pass universal background checks, eliminate gun manufacturers¡¯ immunity from liability.¡± ¡°So let¡¯s finish the job,¡± he added. ¡°Ban assault weapons.

https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/23/us/walmart-shooting.html?searchResultPosition=61,2022-11-23,Shooting at Walmart in Virginia Adds to Nation¡¯s Grim Gun Toll,"Six were killed, as well as the gunman, in the third recent high-profile mass shooting in the United States. By Chris Cameron,?Jenny Gross,?Eliza Fawcett,?Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs and J. David Goodman CHESAPEAKE, Va. ? As nighttime shoppers browsed for household items or Thanksgiving necessities, an employee of a Walmart in Chesapeake, Va., took out a pistol and, without a word, a witness said, opened fire, killing five of his co-workers and a 16-year-old boy, and wounding several others before turning the weapon on himself. The bodies of the gunman and two victims were found in an employee break room, the authorities said, and another near the front of the store. Three died after being taken to nearby hospitals. The burst of workplace violence, just after 10 p.m. on Tuesday, tore at the holiday cheer of a popular shopping center now cordoned off with yellow police tape. And it thrust the nation, again, for the third time in less than two weeks, into a familiar and increasingly frequent cycle of mourning and soul-searching, prayer-sending and finger-pointing, in the aftermath of yet another mass shooting. Days earlier, an attacker killed five people and wounded 18 others at a Colorado Springs nightclub that had been seen as a haven of safety for the local L.G.B.T.Q. community. Earlier this month, a student at the University of Virginia shot and killed three members of the school¡¯s football team on a bus as they returned from a class trip. ¡°Because of yet another horrific and senseless act of violence, there are now even more tables across the country that will have empty seats this Thanksgiving,¡± President Biden said in a statement on Wednesday after the Walmart shooting. Mr. Biden said that gun control legislation signed into law this year in response to the massacre of 19 children and two teachers at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, had not been enough. ¡°We must take greater action,¡± he said. His sentiment was echoed by Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, a Democrat, on Wednesday. Neither said what changes they would seek. Little drew together the shootings this month other than the fact of a gun in the hands of an assailant bent on killing. A manager at a Walmart with a pistol who appeared to have targeted his colleagues, a worker at the store said. A 22-year-old with an AR-15-style rifle and a handgun who may have been motivated by hatred, the police said, to open fire at the nightclub. A college student, also 22, who tried repeatedly to purchase weapons before finally succeeding and then, prosecutors said, aiming to kill some of his classmates. ¡°Our hearts break with the community of Chesapeake this morning,¡± said the Virginia governor, Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, in a statement on Wednesday, adding, ¡°Heinous acts of violence have no place in our communities.¡± The governor ordered flags across the state to be lowered to half-staff on Wednesday, the second time he had done so this month. The police identified the six people killed in the shooting as Lorenzo Gamble, Brian Pendleton, Kellie Pyle, Randall Blevins, Tyneka Johnson and a 16-year-old boy whose name was being withheld. Walmart said the five adults all worked there; the company did not immediately respond to queries about the teenager. It was not clear how the gunman, identified as Andre Bing, 31, had acquired his weapon nor what events led to the shooting. Mr. Bing was an ¡°overnight team lead¡± who had been employed by the company since 2010, Walmart said in a statement. ¡°The devastating news of last night¡¯s shooting at our Chesapeake, Va., store at the hands of one of our associates has hit our Walmart family hard,¡± said Doug McMillon, the president and chief executive of Walmart, in a statement. ¡°My heart hurts for our associates and the Chesapeake community who have lost or injured loved ones.¡± Donya Prioleau said she was working in the store at the time of the shooting and identified the gunman as her overnight manager. She said she had been in the break room when the manager entered and, without a word, began firing. ¡°I just watched three of my friends killed in front of me,¡± Ms. Prioleau said. ¡°I was directly in front of it,¡± she said in a brief phone interview. ¡°None of us deserved to witness that.¡± The first 911 call came in at 10:12 p.m., and officers entered the store about four minutes later, said Chief Mark G. Solesky of the Chesapeake Police Department. By the time they arrived, the gunman was dead. In a statement, city officials said that the gunman acted alone, had been wearing ¡°civilian clothing¡± and carrying a handgun along with multiple magazines, and appeared to have killed himself. At the time of the shooting, there were at least 50 people inside of the store. ¡°There is no clear motive at this time,¡± said Chief Solesky, adding that there was no indication that the gunman was known to the police before the shooting. Shaundrayia Reese, 27, who used to work at the Chesapeake Walmart on an overnight crew, said that she had worked directly with Mr. Bing. He did not seem to have many friends and did not like having his picture taken, Ms. Reese said. He would cover the camera of his phone with black tape, saying that he was concerned about government surveillance. She added that he did not strike her as violent, despite his sometimes odd behavior. ¡°He used to tell us the government was watching him,¡± she said. ¡°Everyone did complain to the managers about Andre¡¯s behavior.¡±? She added: ¡°He was really a loner. He was real lonely.¡± Nathan Sinclair, 21, who previously worked as a manager on the shift before Mr. Bing¡¯s, said that Mr. Bing could be difficult to work with. ¡°He was kind of aggressive,¡± said Mr. Sinclair, who left his job this month. He added that on most nights around 10:15 p.m. ? about the time that Tuesday¡¯s shooting took place ? Mr. Bing would assemble his team for a meeting and hand out assignments. The store closed to customers at 11 p.m. Ms. Reese, who now works at a 7-Eleven, said she also knew two of the victims, including Mr. Pendleton, whom she described as a maintenance janitor who ¡°never had a bad bone in his body.¡± She also knew Mr. Blevins, whom she called ¡°Mr. Randy,¡± and said he had been a longtime member of a team at the store who worked on setting prices and arranging merchandise. Neighbors of Ms. Johnson described her as someone who kept to herself. ¡°She was a sweet young lady,¡± said Irene Hope, 66, adding: ¡°It¡¯s just terrible. Too close to home.¡± Mass shootings in public are more common at workplaces than in other settings, according to a database maintained by the Violence Project, a nonprofit research center that has compiled information on shootings going back decades. In May 2021, a transit worker opened fire as workers gathered for a morning shift at a rail yard in San Jose, Calif., killing nine people. The month before, a former employee shot and killed eight people at a FedEx warehouse in Indianapolis. Both gunmen killed themselves shortly after their rampages. But mass shootings at retail stores have also become increasingly familiar. There was the killing of 10 Black shoppers at a grocery store in Buffalo in May, and the targeting of Hispanic shoppers during a mass shooting that killed 23 at a Walmart in El Paso in 2019. Both gunmen were motivated by racial hatred, the authorities have said. Virginia, home to the headquarters of the National Rifle Association, has historically had permissive gun laws. The state allows the open carrying of handguns without a permit, for example, with some exceptions. But after Democrats took full control of the state government in 2019, the legislature passed new restrictions, including universal background checks, reporting requirements for lost or stolen firearms and some limits on purchasing. Republicans won back the governorship and the House of Delegates a year ago, and the legislature passed no significant gun measures in its 2022 session. Mr. Youngkin has said that he would support repealing some of the Democratic-led policies if Republicans also regained control of the State Senate. Mr. Youngkin said on Wednesday that the shootings in Virginia and elsewhere in recent weeks were an example of the country¡¯s ¡°mental health crisis¡± and suggested he would provide more resources. At the Walmart in Chesapeake, Jeromy Basham had been looking for Thanksgiving tablecloths and disposable cutlery for an office potluck the next day. Then he heard what he described as several loud claps. ¡°I thought someone had knocked over some huge shelf or something,¡± said Mr. Basham, 47, a manager at a company in Virginia Beach. ¡°It was a group of several really, really loud, identical noises, followed with no noise.¡± A few seconds later, he heard people yelling: ¡°It¡¯s a gun! Get out!¡± Because of Walmart¡¯s size and geographic reach ? it has more than 4,000 stores spread across the United States ? the retailer is often the site of crimes, some of them violent. During the coronavirus pandemic, some retailers and their employees have said, violence increased in all types of stores. Walmart has said that it has taken steps to bolster security in some stores, such as installing cameras in parking lots and hiring off-duty police officers during busy shopping days. The store has also frequently been at the center of the debate over gun violence. Although the chain sells guns, Walmart has imposed increasingly strict restrictions on firearm sales in the wake of mass shootings. In recent years, it stopped selling handguns and certain rifles, including AR-15s, and raised the minimum age to purchase firearms to 21. In Chesapeake, the Walmart provided a hub for many residents. Some people interviewed on Wednesday said they visited just days before, preparing for Thanksgiving. Others said they had planned to visit either the night of the shooting or later in the week. By late Wednesday, two victims remained in critical condition, hospital officials said. One of them was Sarah Walker, a Walmart employee and mother of three, who suffered five gunshot wounds, according to Jennie Walp, a friend of Ms. Walker¡¯s. ¡°She was always a force to be reckoned with, determined to work hard to provide for her kids, and always good for a laugh,¡± Ms. Walp said. ¡°It¡¯s definitely shocking to have it hit so close to home, with the ongoing violence that continues to happen all over our country.¡± Reporting was contributed by Michael Corkery, Maggie Astor, Jesus Jimenez, Christine Chung, Jenna Russell and Rich Griset.

Jack Healy,?Mitch Smith,?Adam Goldman and Patricia Mazzei COLORADO SPRINGS ? A man shrouded in body armor and wielding an AR-15 style rifle attacked an L.G.B.T.Q. nightclub in Colorado Springs on Saturday night, in a rampage that killed at least five people and injured at least 25 others. At least one person inside the nightclub, Club Q, tackled and subdued the gunman, the authorities said, helping to prevent further bloodshed. Mayor John Suthers of Colorado Springs said that a man had grabbed a handgun from the gunman and then hit him with it, subduing him. When the police burst into the club, the man was still on top of gunman, pinning him down, Mr. Suthers said. The owners of the club, who had looked at surveillance tape, lauded the actions of two patrons whom they said they did not know but who, together, had overpowered the gunman and held him on the floor until police arrived. ¡°One customer took down the gunman and was assisted by another,¡± said Matthew Haynes, one of the club owners. Referring to the first person who acted, Mr. Haynes added, ¡°He saved dozens and dozens of lives. Stopped the man cold. Everyone else was running away, and he ran toward him.¡± Police officials identified the gunman as Anderson Lee Aldrich, 22. He was injured and treated in a hospital. The police recovered two guns at the club, said Adrian Vasquez, chief of the Colorado Springs Police Department. The authorities said they were still working to determine who owned the long rifle used in the shooting, as well as other weapons found at the scene. Mr. Vasquez said the suspect had not spoken with investigators and did not appear to have said anything at the crime scene. He said the shooting had lasted barely a minute. The local district attorney, Michael J. Allen, said in a statement that his office expected that ¡°the case will officially transfer to my office¡± for a charging decision in the coming days. He said the shooting appeared to have been carried out by a single person. The F.B.I. was also involved in the investigation. The exact number of injured victims was uncertain. Some people had driven themselves to seek treatment, police officials said, and not all injuries were from gunshot wounds. Some may have suffered injuries while fleeing. At least two remained in critical condition on Sunday morning, doctors from two hospitals said. The shooting erupted minutes before midnight, as revelers enjoyed a night out in a club considered a safe haven for the L.G.B.T.Q. community. It was painfully reminiscent of the 2016 massacre at Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando, Fla., where a gunman killed 49 people and wounded 53 others after proclaiming allegiance to the Islamic State terrorist group. Joshua Thurman, who had gone to Club Q for an early birthday celebration, thought the first gunshots were part of the music. He stayed on the dance floor, but when he heard more shots and saw a flash from the muzzle of a gun, he ran to a dressing room at the rear of the club. He stayed there with a drag performer and another patron and described hearing the ¡°pow! pow!¡± of gunshots. ¡°When we came out of the dressing room, we saw bodies,¡± he recalled on Sunday morning, choking back a sob. ¡°There was broken glass, blood ? I lost friends!¡± Mr. Thurman, 34, spoke to reporters outside the club, where he had gone to retrieve his car from the parking lot. He said he had worked at the club as a go-go dancer and that a bartender whom he had come to know over the years was among those killed. Mr. Thurman said Club Q was a ¡°safe place¡± for its patrons: ¡°This is a place we love, a place of peace, a place to be ourselves.¡± The motive behind the attack at Club Q was still unknown. Mayor Suthers said the shooting ¡°has all the appearances of being a hate crime,¡± but he said that investigators were still combing through the gunman¡¯s social media history and doing interviews to determine a motive. President Biden denounced the apparent targeting of the L.G.B.T.Q. community. ¡°Places that are supposed to be safe spaces of acceptance and celebration should never be turned into places of terror and violence,¡± he said in a statement. ¡°We cannot and must not tolerate hate.¡± Mr. Biden renewed his call for a federal assault weapons ban, though there is not enough support in Congress to enact one. ¡°When will we decide we¡¯ve had enough?¡± he asked. ¡°We must address the public health epidemic of gun violence in all of its forms.¡± A man with the same name and age as the club shooting suspect was arrested in June 2021 after the man¡¯s mother had called the police and said that she was not with her son and did not know where he was, but that he had threatened to hurt her with a bomb, ammunition and other weapons. Police negotiators persuaded him to walk out of a house and surrender ? but not before the police had evacuated residents from about 10 nearby houses in a suburban neighborhood just outside of Colorado Springs, because of the bomb threat. The police have not said whether the shooting suspect and the man arrested in 2021 are one and the same. The man was charged with several crimes after that arrest, including felony menacing and three kidnapping charges. It is unclear whom he was accused of kidnapping. The police said in 2021 that they had not found any explosives. A spokesman for the local  district attorney declined to say on Sunday how the charges were resolved. The mother of the Anderson Aldrich involved in that case had been renting a spare room from Leslie Bowman, who said in an interview on Sunday that she had been away at the time. ¡°His mom had called me and said, ¡®Don¡¯t come home right now, there are some people looking for Andy,¡¯¡± Ms. Bowman recalled, using the man¡¯s nickname. On Sunday, after the shooting, Ms. Bowman was left wondering why the man may have been at large and able to get hold of a rifle, if he had been accused of the bomb threat. ¡°Why is he not in jail, after that happening?¡± Ms. Bowman asked. ¡°After that initial day, police never reached out to me for additional information. I¡¯m a Second Amendment supporter, don¡¯t get me wrong. But for him to be out there, and have access to weapons after that incident, I don¡¯t understand it.¡± Efforts to reach family members of the Mr. Aldrich arrested in the shooting on Sunday were unsuccessful. Colorado Springs, a city of about 500,000 people south of Denver, is a Republican stronghold, and for decades it was a center for conservative Christian efforts to pass laws limiting the rights of gay people. But the city, which has long had a small but vibrant L.G.B.T.Q. community, has become more diverse. It now hosts an annual Pride parade, and its fast population growth has diluted the influence of far-right conservatives. Club Q stands on a major commercial boulevard, next to a Walgreens drugstore and a Subway sandwich shop. The club first opened in 2002, in the inconspicuous location behind a strip mall that the founder chose in part because, at the time, patrons needed an entrance where they could come and go without being seen, said Nic Grzecka, who co-owns the club with Mr. Haynes. The owners said that when they reviewed surveillance video of the shooting, they saw the gunman pull up heavily armed and wearing a military-style flak jacket. Mr. Haynes said the gunman had entered the nightclub with ¡°tremendous firepower¡± ? a rifle and what appeared to be six magazines of ammunition ? and began shooting. Police officers arrived and took the gunman into custody within six minutes of receiving an emergency call about the shooting. Mr. Grzecka and Mr. Haynes got there a few minutes later. ¡°It was chaos,¡± Mr. Haynes said. Hours before the shooting, Club Q posted on Facebook about a ¡°musical drag brunch¡± on Sunday morning to mark the Transgender Day of Remembrance, which honors the memory of those who lost their lives to anti-transgender violence. After the 2016 mass shooting at Pulse, Mr. Haynes said he and Mr. Grzecka were ¡°vigilant¡± about security at their club. ¡°We¡¯ve worked with the Colorado Springs Police Department and the F.B.I. in response to various threats over the years,¡± he said. ¡°But there had been no known recent threats toward Club Q.¡± After the Pulse shooting, Mr. Grzecka said, the gay community in Colorado Springs had come together, ¡°thinking we were taking a stance.¡± He added, ¡°We had this vigil, standing in our parking lot, never thinking this was going to happen in our community.¡± Jack Healy reported from Colorado Springs, Mitch Smith from Chicago, Adam Goldman from Washington and Patricia Mazzei from Miami. Reporting was contributed by Noel Black, Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs, Charlie Brennan, Emma Bubola, Emily Cochrane, Jill Cowan, Eliza Fawcett, Eduardo Medina, Dave Philipps, V?ctor Manuel Ramos, April Rubin, Ava Sasani, Mindy Sink, Luke Vander Ploeg, Daniel Victor and Cassandra Vinograd. Alain Delaqu?ri?re and Kirsten Noyes contributed research.  Luke Vander Ploeg Kelly Loving, 40, was among the five people killed in the Saturday night shooting at Club Q in Colorado Springs, just a short while after she had spoken to her friend on the phone. She was visiting the nightclub during a weekend trip from her home in Denver, the friend said. Ms. Loving¡¯s sister, Tiffany Loving, said that she found out about her sister¡¯s death from the F.B.I. on Sunday. ¡°She was loving, always trying to help the next person out instead of thinking of herself. She just was a caring person,¡± she said. ¡°I was really close with her.¡± Natalee Skye Bingham, who said she was a close friend of Ms. Loving, said that they had known each other for years, going back to when they both lived in Florida. ¡°I¡¯m so devastated because she was such a good person,¡± said Ms. Bingham, 25. ¡°She was going to be at my house for Thanksgiving this upcoming Thursday and, now, it¡¯s one less person at my table.¡± Ms. Bingham said that Ms. Loving had only recently moved to Denver. ¡°She was a tough woman,¡± Ms. Bingham said. ¡°She taught me how it was to be a trans woman and live your life day to day.¡± Ms. Bingham said that she had been on a FaceTime call with Ms. Loving, who was speaking from inside Club Q, just minutes before the shooting began. She said the last words that she said to Ms. Loving were, ¡°Be safe. I love you.¡± ¡°She was like a trans mother to me. I looked up to her,¡± Ms. Bingham said. ¡°In the gay community you create your families, so it¡¯s like I lost my real mother almost.¡±  Eliza Fawcett and Jill Cowan Shortly after midnight on Sunday, John Loveall received a call from his son, who said that he had been shot in the leg by a gunman at Club Q in Colorado Springs. ¡°He¡¯d just come back in from the smoking area, and all of a sudden they heard the rat-tat-tat-tat automatic weapon going off,¡± Mr. Loveall, 52, of Colorado Springs, said his son told him. His son, Jerecho Loveall, 30, survived the massacre and knew some of the people who were killed, John Loveall said. Jerecho Loveall went to St. Francis Hospital after he started to feel pain in his leg, which he at first thought was a scratch. There, he recalled, he ¡°was informed there was a through and through bullet wound in my leg,¡± meaning that the bullet had passed through. He was discharged from the hospital around 6 a.m. Sunday morning and was recovering at home, his father said. Jerecho Loveall had been at the nightclub to support a cousin who organizes shows and sometimes performs there, said John Loveall, who described Club Q as a refuge for the queer community of Colorado Springs. ¡°It¡¯s one of the few places that the gay community can go to that they felt fairly safe at, without issues from other people,¡± he said. ¡°It¡¯s unfortunate. Nobody should have to worry when they go out to dance.¡± ¡°It doesn¡¯t make any sense that stuff like this is still going on,¡± he said, adding that the mass shooting emphasized certain weapons ¡°don¡¯t need to be out for the common people to have.¡±  Simon Romero COLORADO SPRINGS ? Some two dozen people gathered for a subdued prayer vigil on Sunday afternoon near the nightclub where a gunman killed at least five people overnight. Those in attendance lit candles, recited prayers and offered hugs to one another at St. Paul¡¯s United Methodist Church. Many had ties to Club Q and the victims. ¡°This club was a refuge for our community,¡± said Bird Berg, 31, a produce manager at a grocery store who attended the vigil with her wife, Kourtney Berg, 31. ¡°I¡¯m completely devastated at how this can happen again and again.¡± The Bergs, who grew up in Colorado Springs, said they had been frequenting the club, which was open to underage patrons some nights each week, since they were in high school. They both knew two of the victims who were fatally shot, they said. Kourtney Berg, who works at a medical marijuana dispensary, said Club Q was considered one of the few venues where young people in the L.G.B.T.Q. community could feel welcome and safe in a city known for its conservatism. Kourtney said the latest tragedy brought back memories of another mass shooting in Colorado Springs in 2015, when a gunman with anti-abortion views opened fire at a Planned Parenthood clinic, killing three people and injuring nine. ¡°To be honest, I don¡¯t see a solution to these things,¡± Kourtney said after the vigil, wiping tears away. ¡°Access to guns is never going to go away.¡± Others at the vigil were grasping for ways to understand what had happened. The Rev. David Petty, the pastor at St. Paul¡¯s, recited a meditation that he wrote five years ago in the aftermath of another mass shooting, when a gunman killed 58 people at a music festival in Las Vegas. ¡°After all, we have done this before,¡± Rev. Petty said, reading from his pages as people wiped their tears away. ¡°We will talk about mental health, and terrorism, and we¡¯ll talk about hate and love.¡± ¡°We will shout opinions across the internet, and we will unfriend those who make us upset,¡± he added. ¡°There will be memorials, and vigils, and thoughts and prayers. We have done this before.¡±  Jill Cowan Jerecho Loveall, 30, said he was standing by the bar near the front door of Club Q, watching the dance floor, when the gunman came in shooting. ¡°By the time I turned around, the bullets were flying around my head, breaking the glass around me,¡± he said. He heard screams as he laid face down, and didn¡¯t realize he was bleeding until he got outside later and started to feel pain in his leg. He was driven to the hospital where, he said, he ¡°was informed there was a through-and-through bullet wound in my leg.¡±  Jack Healy COLORADO SPRINGS ? Chief Adrian Vasquez of the Colorado Springs Police Department said late Sunday that the suspect in the shooting rampage at Club Q had not spoken with investigators and did not appear to have said anything at the crime scene. He said the shooting just before midnight on Saturday had lasted barely a minute ? but that was still enough time for the gunman to kill five people and leave more than two dozen others injured. He said investigators had recovered a handgun and long gun with an AR-15-style platform at the scene as well as additional rounds and magazines, but he did not offer more specifics or give any details on when or where the guns had been purchased. Chief Vasquez said there did not appear to have been any prior threats against Club Q, and said the club had long been a low-key presence from a law-enforcement perspective. ¡°It¡¯s not a club that from a police perspective we got to a lot,¡± Chief Vasquez said in an interview. ¡°It¡¯s not on our radar as a high volume of calls or anything like that.¡± Mr. Vasquez got the job of chief of police in April after spending more than 25 years with the Colorado Springs Police Department. He is familiar with the long trauma of mass shootings in a community, having been the homicide lieutenant during the shooting rampage at a Planned Parenthood clinic, also in Colorado Springs, in November 2015. ¡°The emotional impact on people carries on for years and years,¡± he said. He said he had been asleep when he received a page and then a phone call alerting him to the shooting at the nightclub. He spent hours at the crime scene early Sunday morning.  Jack Healy Chief Adrian Vasquez of the Colorado Springs Police Department said the suspect had not spoken with investigators and did not appear to have said anything at the crime scene.  Dave Philipps and Charlie Brennan COLORADO SPRINGS ? The patron who tackled a gunman inside a gay nightclub in Colorado Springs on Saturday night prevented a deadly shooting from being far worse, the club¡¯s owners said on Sunday. ¡°He saved dozens and dozens of lives,¡± one of the owners of Club Q, Matthew Haynes, said at a vigil. ¡°Stopped the man cold. Everyone else was running away, and he ran toward him.¡± Mr. Haynes and the club¡¯s other owner, Nic Grzecka, said they had reviewed surveillance video that showed the gunman enter the building and immediately begin firing. Customers and staff members were among the five dead and more than two dozen wounded, they said. Mr. Grzecka estimated that the shooting lasted no more than two minutes before a patron subdued the gunman, and another helped hold him down. Police arrived about three minutes later, he said. ¡°I don¡¯t even know the names of these people,¡± Mr. Grzecka said. ¡°But what they did is incredible.¡± Mayor John Suthers of Colorado Springs said the person who subdued the gunman had grabbed a handgun from him and hit him with it. ¡°It was quite something,¡± Suthers told The New York Times in a phone interview. ¡°It happened quite quickly.¡± Mr. Haynes said Club Q had an active shooter protocol, which he said had been ¡°followed to the letter.¡± The two owners arrived at the scene shortly after the shooting ended, they said. Neither would describe in detail what they saw. ¡°It was a crime scene,¡± Mr. Haynes said, but he added that he noticed people trying to help each other in those first minutes. ¡°There were lots of mini-heroes who were taking people home, making sure people were safe,¡± Mr. Haynes said. The crowd inside Club Q on Saturday night was smaller than usual, Mr. Haynes said, because of the colder weather that had recently set in. ¡°We were moderate to light,¡± Mr. Haynes said. ¡°We were very fortunate we did not have our usual Saturday night crowd last night.¡± Recordings from surveillance cameras inside the club have been turned over to investigators, and the club¡¯s owners have scoured their records to see if the man who has been identified by police as the suspect had ever visited the club. ¡°To our knowledge, he has not entered our building before,¡± Mr. Haynes said. Jack Healy contributed reporting.  Mitch Smith The fire department radios in Colorado Springs were mostly quiet as Saturday night was fading into Sunday morning. Then, right around midnight, the call came in. ¡°This will be a command four, active shooter,¡± a male voice said over the dispatch channel. He continued: ¡°3430 N. Academy Blvd. Club Q. Active shooter. All units respond.¡± Emergency dispatch audio, archived by Broadcastify, showed how a mass mobilization of ambulances and fire trucks came together early Sunday after a gunman opened fire at the L.G.B.T.Q. nightclub. As the victim count steadily increased, and dispatchers scrambled to find ambulances to carry the wounded, the horror of what had just happened started to become clear: At least five people were dead and 25 injured. Minutes after the first call went out, someone on a fire engine asked over the radio if dispatchers knew the number of victims. A man responded that they were on the phone with a victim and said, ¡°We are getting reports of four to seven possibly injured.¡± He said two ambulances from a private company were heading to the club, along with several police units. He added: ¡°No indication a suspect has been detained yet.¡± Not long after, as fire crews were arriving at the scene, medics were told they were clear to enter the building ? a directive that the fire chief, Randy Royal, later said was given immediately after the gunman was subdued. As the first medical crews arrived, dispatchers radioed that they were still working on finding more ambulances from other departments to head to the scene. ¡°They¡¯re trying to get seven¡± ambulances, a dispatcher said. ¡°They do want you guys to go in, and they¡¯re still working on getting their seven.¡± All the while, the scope of the crisis continued to grow. ¡°Reports of 10 people shot, which makes it a mass casualty,¡± a man said over the radio. ¡°Seven ambulances. We¡¯ll let you determine how many more fire apparatuses you need.¡± Firefighters and paramedics relayed grim accounts of the scene: ¡°We have one gunshot, through and through,¡± one person said. Another said there ¡°are at least four patients that we¡¯ve found.¡± An incident commander directed some responders to a ¡°casualty collection point.¡± ¡°Start doing triage,¡± the commander said. ¡°I¡¯m bringing you gurneys on foot.¡± Firefighters and dispatchers were composed and matter-of-fact in their radio discussions, but the transmissions also describe complications caused by vehicles blocking the road and a sprawling crime scene. At one point, a commander at the scene directed an ambulance to a nearby 7-Eleven convenience store where a victim with seven gunshot wounds was being treated. As the search continued, the casualty count continued to climb. Dispatchers contacted hospitals, which had activated their trauma teams, to make sure they had enough room. Commanders gave a mix of parking advice and medical instructions to the ambulances racing to the scene. ¡°At this point, I¡¯ll give you an approximate number of 12, one-two, victims, that¡¯s obviously tentative at this time,¡± a man said in one transmission. ¡°We do have multiple criticals.¡± After roughly 40 hectic minutes, as ambulances set off for hospitals, someone asked for a count of remaining victims. A man responded that he believed everyone was out of the building. ¡°We have nobody in the casualty collection point,¡± he said, ¡°so we believe everyone is accounted for.¡±  Jack Healy COLORADO SPRINGS ? Mayor John Suthers of Colorado Springs offered new details late Sunday about the fatal rampage inside Club Q, an L.G.B.T.Q. nightclub in his city, saying it ended when someone acted quickly to grab a handgun from the gunman, then hit him with it, subduing him. When police burst into the club minutes later, the man who had slugged the gunman was still on top of him, pinning him down, Mr. Suthers said. The shooting had started just a few minutes before midnight on Saturday, when the gunman opened fire with a long rifle, killing at least five people and injuring more than two dozen, the police said. ¡°It was quite something,¡± Mr. Suthers said in an interview with The New York Times. ¡°It happened quite quickly. This individual was totally disabled by 12:02. That had a lot to do with the intervention of these patrons.¡± It was unclear whether the gunman had fired the handgun, Mr. Suthers said. Mr. Suthers said the shooting ¡°has all the appearances of being a hate crime,¡± but that investigators were still going through the suspect¡¯s social media history and conducting interviews in search of a motive. He said the club had been operating for 21 years, and had not reported any threats before Saturday¡¯s attack.  Dave Philipps The owners of Club Q, Matthew Haynes and Nic Grzecka, said one of the bar¡¯s patrons had rushed the gunman and subdued him, then another had helped to hold the man down. ¡°I don¡¯t even know the names of these people,¡± Grzecka said. ¡°But what they did is incredible.¡±  Jack Healy Mayor John Suthers of Colorado Springs said that someone in the club had acted quickly to grab a handgun from the suspect, then hit him with it, subduing him. When police burst into the club, the man was still on top of gunman, pinning him down, Suthers said. ¡°It was quite something,¡± Suthers told The New York Times in a phone interview. ¡°It happened quite quickly.¡±  Jack Healy Mayor Suthers said the shooting ¡°has all the appearances of being a hate crime,¡± but he said that investigators were still combing through the suspect¡¯s social media history and doing interviews to determine a motive.  Ava Sasani Tiara Kelley, who hosts a weekly drag show at Club Q, moved to Denver from Orlando in 2019. She said the shooting stirred dark memories of the 2016 massacre at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, in which she lost several friends. ¡°It¡¯s like living a nightmare all over again,¡± she said. ¡°Processing isn¡¯t easier the second time. It might be worse.¡±  Mindy Sink Leia Arnold had just finished a dance number at Club Q Saturday night when she heard there was a gunman, she said at a vigil Sunday. She said she saw a man with a rifle, then heard ¡°a bunch of shots and screaming,"" and saw a bartender jump in front of the gunman. Asked if the barman had died, she nodded, tears in her eyes.  Noel Black The gunman who opened fire at Club Q on Saturday night, killing at least five people, pulled up outside the Colorado Springs nightclub heavily armed and wearing a military-style flak jacket, according to the club¡¯s owners, who have reviewed surveillance video of the episode. The club owners, Nic Grzecka and Matthew Haynes, said on Sunday that they did not know the man who has been identified by police as the gunman, Anderson Lee Aldrich. Mr. Haynes said the gunman had entered the nightclub with ¡°tremendous firepower¡± ? a rifle and what appeared to be six magazines of ammunition ? and began shooting. Police officers arrived and took the suspected gunman into custody within six minutes of receiving an emergency call about the shooting. Mr. Grzecka and Mr. Haynes got there a few minutes later. ¡°It was chaos,¡± Mr. Haynes said. He said Club Q had been ¡°a safe place for the L.G.B.T.Q.+ community and their allies for 21 years.¡± After the 2016 mass shooting at Pulse, a crowded gay nightclub in Orlando, Fla., where 49 people were killed, Mr. Haynes said he and Mr. Grzecka were ¡°vigilant¡± about security at their club. ¡°We¡¯ve worked with the Colorado Springs Police Department and the F.B.I. in response to various threats over the years,¡± he said. ¡°But there had been no known recent threats toward Club Q.¡± After the Pulse shooting, Mr. Grzecka said, the gay community in Colorado Springs had come together, ¡°thinking we were taking a stance.¡± He added, ¡°We had this vigil, standing in our parking lot, never thinking this was going to happen in our community.¡± An earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of one of Club Q¡¯s owners. He is Nic Grzecka, not Nick. How we handle corrections  Charlie Brennan,?Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs and April Rubin The man identified by authorities as the suspect in the nightclub shooting in Colorado Springs Saturday night appears to have been arrested last year, accused of engaging in a lengthy standoff with the police after threatening to hurt his mother with a homemade bomb. A man with the same name and age as the club shooting suspect, Anderson L. Aldrich, was arrested in June 2021 after police negotiators managed to persuade him to walk out of a house and surrender ? but not before the police had evacuated residents from about 10 nearby houses in a suburban neighborhood just outside of Colorado Springs, because of the possible bomb threat. The police have not said whether the shooting suspect and the man arrested in 2021 are one and the same. In the earlier incident, the man¡¯s mother had called the police and said that she was not with her son and did not know where he was, but that he had threatened to hurt her with a bomb, ammunition and other weapons. Mr. Aldrich was charged with several crimes after that arrest, including felony menacing and three kidnapping charges. It is unclear whom he was accused of kidnapping. The police said in 2021 that they had not found any explosives. A spokesman for the El Paso County district attorney declined to say on Sunday how the charges were resolved. Leslie Bowman said in an interview that the frightening 2021 incident took place at her home, where she had been renting a spare room to Mr. Aldrich¡¯s mother, Laura Voepel. Ms. Bowman said she was away from the house during the 2021 incident. ¡°His mom had called me and said, ¡®Don¡¯t come home right now, there are some people looking for Andy,¡¯¡± Ms. Bowman recalled, using Mr. Aldrich¡¯s nickname. Two days after the incident, Ms. Bowman arranged to have Ms. Voepel move out of her home. ¡°Once she was gone, I changed the code on the door, and I never saw or heard from her again,¡± Ms. Bowman said. But about a month ago, she said, the police visited Ms. Bowman and said they were looking for Ms. Voepel to check on her welfare, though Ms. Bowman did not know why. Ms. Bowman said she believed that Mr. Aldrich had been living nearby in a house with his grandparents while Ms. Voepel was renting the room. He would sometimes visit his mother and watch movies with her. Ms. Bowman also remembered that Mr. Aldrich appeared to have an ¡°aggressive side,¡± and recalled one instance in which his mother had a complaint about a repair issue in the bathroom. Mr. Aldrich slammed a door in Ms. Bowman¡¯s face in anger over the incident, she said. On Sunday, after the shooting, Ms. Bowman was left wondering why Mr. Aldrich may have been at large and able to get hold of a rifle, if he had been accused of the bomb threat. ¡°Why is he not in jail, after that happening?¡± Ms. Bowman asked. ¡°After that initial day, police never reached out to me for additional information. I¡¯m a Second Amendment supporter, don¡¯t get me wrong. But for him to be out there, and have access to weapons after that incident, I don¡¯t understand it.¡±  Mitch Smith Colorado Springs officials said in a news release that investigators were still working to determine who owned the long rifle used in the shooting, as well as other weaponry found at the scene.  Mitch Smith Twenty-five people were injured in the shooting, seven more than the initial count, the Colorado Springs police said in an update. It was not clear how many were shot or how many sustained injuries while fleeing. Five people died in the attack.  Mitch Smith F.B.I. agents are assisting the Colorado Springs police, the bureau's Denver office said, adding that federal officials would ¡°review all available facts of the incident to determine what federal response is warranted.¡±  Emily Cochrane ¡°Places that are supposed to be safe spaces of acceptance and celebration should never be turned into places of terror and violence,¡± President Biden said in a statement. ¡°Yet it happens far too often. We must drive out the inequities that contribute to violence against L.G.B.T.Q.I.+ people. We cannot and must not tolerate hate.¡±  Emily Cochrane Mr. Biden renewed his call for a federal assault weapons ban, though there is not enough support in Congress now to enact one. ¡°When will we decide we¡¯ve had enough?¡± he asked. ¡°We must address the public health epidemic of gun violence in all of its forms.¡±  Mindy Sink and Emma Bubola Joshua Thurman thought the first gunshots were part of the music, and kept dancing. When a gunman opened fire inside Club Q Saturday night, killing at least five people, Mr. Thurman was at the club for an early birthday celebration. He said he was on the dance floor when the shooting started, and didn¡¯t realize right away what was happening. But when he heard more shots and saw a flash from the muzzle of a gun, he ran to a dressing room at the rear of the club. He stayed in the dressing room with a drag performer and another patron, and described hearing the ¡°pow! pow!¡± of gunshots. ¡°When we came out of the dressing room, we saw bodies,¡± he recalled, choking back a sob, on Sunday morning. ¡°There was broken glass, blood ? I lost friends!¡± Mr. Thurman, 34, spoke to reporters Sunday morning outside the club, where he had come to retrieve his car from the parking lot. He said he used to work at the club as a go-go dancer, and that a bartender who had become a close acquaintance over the years was among those who were killed. Mr. Thurman, whose apartment is nearby, said Club Q was a ¡°safe place¡± for its patrons: ¡°This is a place we love, a place of peace, a place to be ourselves.¡± Angelo Patino, 18, a drag performer who left the club about a half-hour before the shooting, said Club Q was a place where he could express himself the way he wanted, within a community that ¡°will be happy for you.¡± He woke up on Sunday to reports that at least one person he knew had been killed. ¡°I always felt protected there, no matter what,¡± Mr.",NYT
https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/30/us/politics/nra-congress-firearms.html?searchResultPosition=63,2023-07-30,The Secret History of Gun Rights: How Lawmakers Armed the N.R.A.,"They served in Congress and on the N.R.A.¡¯s board at the same time. Over decades, a small group of legislators led by a prominent Democrat pushed the gun lobby to help transform the law, the courts and views on the Second Amendment. By Mike McIntire Long before the National Rifle Association tightened its grip on Congress, won over the Supreme Court and prescribed more guns as a solution to gun violence ? before all that, Representative John D. Dingell Jr. had a plan. First jotted on a yellow legal pad in 1975, it would transform the N.R.A. from a fusty club of sportsmen into a lobbying juggernaut that would enforce elected officials¡¯ allegiance, derail legislation behind the scenes, redefine the legal landscape and deploy ¡°all available resources at every level to influence the decision making process.¡± ¡°An organization with as many members, and as many potential resources, both financial and influential within its ranks, should not have to go 2d or 3d Class in a fight for survival,¡± Mr. Dingell wrote, advocating a new aggressive strategy. ¡°It should go First Class.¡± To understand the ascendancy of gun culture in America, the files of Mr. Dingell, a powerful Michigan Democrat who died in 2019, are a good place to start. That is because he was not just a politician ? he simultaneously sat on the N.R.A.¡¯s board of directors, positioning him to influence firearms policy as well as the private lobbying force responsible for shaping it. And he was not alone. Mr. Dingell was one of at least nine senators and representatives, both Republicans and Democrats, with the same dual role over the last half-century ? lawmaker-directors who helped the N.R.A. accumulate and exercise unrivaled power. Their actions are documented in thousands of pages of records obtained by The New York Times, through a search of lawmakers¡¯ official archives, the papers of other N.R.A. directors and court cases. The files, many of them only recently made public, reveal a secret history of how the nation got to where it is now. Over decades, politics, money and ideology altered gun culture, reframed the Second Amendment to embrace ever broader gun rights and opened the door to relentless marketing driven by fear rather than sport. With more than 400 million firearms in civilian hands today and mass shootings now routine, Americans are bitterly divided over what the right to bear arms should mean. The lawmakers, far from the stereotype of pliable politicians meekly accepting talking points from lobbyists, served as leaders of the N.R.A., often prodding it to action. At seemingly every hint of a legislative threat, they stepped up, the documents show, helping erect a firewall that impedes gun control today. ¡°Talk about being strategic people in a place to make things happen,¡± an N.R.A. executive gushed at a board meeting after Congress voted down gun restrictions following the 1999 Columbine shooting. ¡°Thank you. Thank you.¡± The fact that some members of Congress served on the N.R.A. board is not new. But much of what they did for the gun group, and how, was not publicly known. Representative Bob Barr, a Georgia Republican, sent confidential memos to the N.R.A. leader Wayne LaPierre, urging action against gun violence lawsuits. Senator Ted Stevens, an Alaska Republican, chided fellow board members for failing to advance a bill that rolled back gun restrictions, and told them how to do it. Republican Representative John M. Ashbrook of Ohio co-wrote a letter to the board describing ¡°very subtle and complex¡± tactics to support ¡°candidates friendly to our cause and actions to defeat or discipline those who are hostile.¡± Senator Larry E. Craig, an Idaho Republican who was a key strategic partner for the N.R.A., flagged and scuttled a proposal to require the use of gun safety locks. And then there was Mr. Dingell. In a private letter in October 1978, the N.R.A. president, Lloyd Mustin, said his ¡°insights and guidance on the details of any gun-related matter pending in the Congress¡± were ¡°uniformly successful.¡± Just as valuable, he said, was the congressman¡¯s stealthy manipulation of the legislative process. ¡°These actions by him are often carefully obscured,¡± Mr. Mustin wrote, so they may ¡°not be recognized or understood by the uninitiated observer.¡± As chairman of the powerful House commerce committee, Mr. Dingell would send ¡°Dingellgrams¡± ? demands for information from federal agencies ? drafted by the N.R.A. Other times, on learning of a lawmaker¡¯s plan to introduce a bill, he would scribble a note to an aide saying, ¡°Notify N.R.A.¡± Beginning in the 1970s, he pushed the group to fund legal work that could help win court cases and enshrine policy protections. The impact would be far-reaching: Some of the earliest N.R.A.-backed scholars were later cited in the Supreme Court¡¯s District of Columbia vs. Heller decision affirming an individual right to own a gun, as well as a ruling last year that established a new legal test invalidating many restrictions. The files of Mr. Dingell, the longest-serving member of Congress, were donated to the University of Michigan but remained off-limits for nearly eight years. They were only made available in May, five months after The Times began pressing for their release. Mr. Barr, who has remained on the N.R.A. board since leaving government in 2003, said in an interview that he did not recall the memos he wrote to Mr. LaPierre, which were among the congressman¡¯s papers at the University of West Georgia. But during his nearly six years in office while also a N.R.A. director, he said, the group ¡°never approached me to do anything that I didn¡¯t want to do or that I would not have done anyway.¡± ¡°I¡¯m doing it as a member of Congress who also happens to be an N.R.A. board member,¡± Mr. Barr said. N.R.A. manuals say its board has a ¡°special trust¡± to ensure the organization¡¯s success and to protect the Second Amendment ¡°in the legislative and political arenas.¡± Under ethics rules, lawmakers may serve as unpaid directors of nonprofits, and the gun group is classified by the I.R.S. as a nonprofit ¡°social welfare organization.¡± No current legislators serve on its board. In 2004, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence objected to three Republican lawmakers then serving as unpaid N.R.A. directors: Mr. Craig and Representatives Don Young of Alaska and Barbara Cubin of Wyoming. The Brady organization argued that their fiduciary duty to the N.R.A. conflicted with their government roles. ¡°Here, the lobbyist and the lobbied are the same,¡± said the complaint. It was rejected by Senate and House ethics committees. Mr. Dingell eventually left the N.R.A. board. The turning point was his support for a 1994 crime bill that included an assault weapons ban. In a terse resignation letter, he acknowledged a problem in serving as an elected official and a director ? though he would continue to work closely with the group for years. ¡°I deeply regret,¡± Mr. Dingell wrote, ¡°that the conflict between my responsibilities as a Member of Congress and my duties as a board member of the National Rifle Association is irreconcilable.¡± John Dingell was comfortable with firearms at an early age: When not blasting ducks with a shotgun, he was plinking rats with an air gun in the basement of the U.S. Capitol, where he served as a page. They were pursuits he picked up from his father, a New Deal Democrat representing a House district in Detroit¡¯s working-class suburbs, who enjoyed hunting and championed conservation causes. After serving in the Army in World War II, the younger Mr. Dingell earned a law degree and worked as a prosecutor. He succeeded his father in 1955 at age 29. Nicknamed ¡°the Truck¡± as much for his forceful personality as his 6-foot-3 frame, Mr. Dingell was an imposing presence in the House, where he became a Democratic Party favorite for pushing liberal causes like national health insurance. Mr. Dingell recalled, in a 2016 interview, that he saw President John F. Kennedy ¡°fairly frequently¡± at the White House and generally ¡°traveled the same philosophical path.¡± ¡°Except on firearms,¡± he added. In December 1963, just weeks after Mr. Kennedy was murdered with a rifle bought through an N.R.A. magazine ad, Mr. Dingell complained at a hearing about ¡°a growing prejudice against firearms¡± and defended buying guns through the mail. His advocacy made him popular with the N.R.A., and by 1968 he had joined at least one other member of Congress on its board. Historically, the N.R.A.¡¯s opposition to firearms laws was tempered. Founded in 1871 by two Union Army veterans ? a lawyer and a former New York Times correspondent ? the association promoted rifle training and marksmanship. It did not actively challenge the Supreme Court¡¯s view, stated in 1939, that the Second Amendment¡¯s protection of gun ownership applied to membership in a ¡°well regulated Militia¡± rather than an individual right unconnected to the common defense. During the 1960s, public outrage over political assassinations and street violence led to calls for stronger laws, culminating in the Gun Control Act, the most significant firearms bill since the 1930s. The law would restrict interstate sales, require serial numbers on firearms and make addiction or mental illness potential disqualifiers for ownership. The N.R.A. was divided, with a top official complaining about parts of the bill while also saying it was something ¡°the sportsmen of America can live with.¡± President Lyndon B. Johnson wanted the bill to be even stronger, requiring gun registration and licensing, and angrily blamed an N.R.A. letter-writing campaign for weakening it. The Justice Department briefly investigated whether the group had lobbied without registering, and in F.B.I. interviews, N.R.A. officials ¡°pointed out¡± that members of Congress sat on its board, as if that defused any lobbying concerns. (The case was closed when the N.R.A. agreed to register.) The debate over the Gun Control Act agitated Mr. Dingell, his files show. He asked the Library of Congress to research Nazi-era gun confiscations in Germany to help prove that regulating firearms was a slippery slope. He considered investigating NBC News for a gun rights segment he viewed as one-sided. At an N.R.A. meeting, he railed about a ¡°patriotic duty¡± to oppose the ¡°ultimate disarming of the law-abiding citizen.¡± As Mr. Johnson prepared to sign the act in fall 1968, Mr. Dingell was convinced that gun ownership faced an existential threat and wrote to an N.R.A. executive suggesting a bold strategy. The group, he said, must ¡°begin moving toward a legislative program¡± to codify an individual¡¯s right to bear arms ¡°for sporting and defense purposes.¡± It was a major departure from the Supreme Court¡¯s sparse record on Second Amendment issues up to that point. The move would neutralize arguments for tighter gun restrictions in Congress and all 50 states, he said. ¡°By being bottomed on the federal constitutional right to bear arms,¡± he wrote, ¡°these same minimal requirements must be imposed upon state statutes and local ordinances.¡± Mr. Dingell¡¯s legislative acumen proved indispensable to the gun lobby. The 1972 Consumer Products Safety Act, designed to protect Americans from defective products, might have reduced firearms accidents that killed or injured thousands each year. But the N.R.A. viewed it as a backdoor to gun control, and Mr. Dingell slipped in an amendment to the new law, exempting from regulatory oversight items taxed under ¡°section 4181 of the Internal Revenue Code¡± ? which only covers firearms and ammunition. While Mr. Dingell¡¯s office was publicly boasting in 1974 of his bill to restrict ¡°Saturday night specials,¡± cheap handguns often used in crimes, C.R. Gutermuth, then the N.R.A.¡¯s president, confided in a private letter that the congressman had only introduced it to ¡°effectively prevent¡± stronger bills. ¡°Obviously, this comes under the heading of legislative maneuvering and strategy,¡± he wrote. Still, the public generally favored stricter limits. After a 3-year-old Baltimore boy accidentally killed a 7-year-old friend with an unsecured handgun, a constituent wrote to Mr. Dingell asking, ¡°How long is it going to be before Congress takes effective action?¡± He instructed an aide to ¡°not answer.¡± When the N.R.A. board met in March 1974, Mr. Gutermuth reported that ¡°Congressman Dingell and some of our other good friends on The Hill keep telling us that we soon will have another rugged firearms battle on our hands.¡± Yet he expressed dismay that N.R.A. staff had not come up with a ¡°concrete proposal¡± to fend it off. Mr. Dingell had an idea. In memos to the board, he complained of the N.R.A.¡¯s ¡°leisurely response to the legislative threat¡± and proposed a new lobbying operation. Handwritten notes reflect just how radical his plans were. He initially said the group, which traditionally stayed out of political races, would ¡°not endorse candidates for public office¡± ? only to cross that out with his pen; the N.R.A. would indeed start doing that, through a newly created Political Victory Fund. The organization¡¯s old guard, whose focus continued to be largely on hunting and sports shooting, was uncomfortable. Mr. Gutermuth, a conservationist with little political experience, wrote to a colleague that Mr. Dingell ¡°wants an all out action program that goes way beyond what we think we dare sponsor.¡± ¡°John seems to think that we should become involved in partisan politics,¡± he said. Mr. Dingell got his way. A 33-page document ? ¡°Plan for the Organization, Operation and Support of the NRA Institute for Legislative Action¡± ? was wide-ranging. The proposal, largely written by Mr. Dingell, called for an unprecedented national lobbying push supported by grass-roots fund-raising, a media operation and opposition research. It would ¡°maintain files for each member of Congress and key members of the executive branch, relative to N.R.A. legislative interests,¡± and ¡°using computerized data, bring influence to bear on elected officials.¡± The plan reflected Mr. Dingell¡¯s savvy as a lawmaker: ¡°For greatest effectiveness and economy, whenever possible, influence legislation at the lowest level of the legislative structure and at the earliest time.¡± Walt Sanders, a former legislative director for Mr. Dingell, said the congressman viewed the N.R.A. as useful to his goal of protecting and expanding gun rights, particularly by heading off efforts to impose new restrictions. ¡°He believed very strongly that he could affect gun control legislation as a senior member of Congress and use the resources of the N.R.A. as leverage,¡± Mr. Sanders said. The changes mirrored an increasingly uncompromising outlook within the N.R.A. membership. In what became known as the ¡°Revolt at Cincinnati,¡± a group of hard-liners seized control of the group at its 1977 convention. The coup drew inspiration from Mr. Dingell, who a month before had circulated a blistering attack on the incumbent leadership. He was revered by many members, who saw little distinction between his roles as a lawmaker and an N.R.A. director, and would write letters praising his fight on their behalf against ¡°gun-grabbers.¡± In his responses, he would sometimes correct the impression that he represented the N.R.A. in Congress. ¡°I try to keep my responsibilities in the two capacities separate so that there is no basic conflict,¡± he wrote to one constituent. When gunshots claimed the life of John Lennon in December 1980 and nearly killed President Ronald Reagan a few months later, the N.R.A. readied itself for a familiar battle. Its officials, meeting in May 1981, grumbled that their ¡°priorities, plans and activities have necessarily been altered.¡± But remarkably, no new gun restrictions made it through Congress. The group saw the failure of gun control efforts to gain traction as a validation of its new agenda and a sign that, with Reagan¡¯s election, there was ¡°a new mood in the country.¡± The N.R.A. and its congressional allies seized the moment, eventually pushing through the most significant pro-gun bill in history, the Firearms Owners¡¯ Protection Act of 1986, which rolled back elements of the Gun Control Act. The bill ? largely written by Mr. Dingell but sponsored by Representative Harold L. Volkmer, a Missouri Democrat who would later join the N.R.A. board ? was opposed by police groups. It lifted some restrictions on gun shows, sales of mail-order ammunition and the interstate transport of firearms. The N.R.A. also went ahead with Mr. Dingell¡¯s plans ¡°to develop a legal climate that would preclude, or at least inhibit, serious consideration of many anti-gun proposals.¡± A strategy document from April 1983 laid out the long-term goal: ¡°When a gun control case finally reaches the Supreme Court, we want Justices¡¯ secretaries to find an existing background of law review articles and lower court cases espousing individual rights.¡± The document listed several scholars the N.R.A. was supporting. Decades later, their work would be cited in the Supreme Court¡¯s landmark 2008 decision in Heller, affirming gun ownership as an individual right. And it would surface in last year¡¯s New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen ruling, which established a right to carry a firearm in public and a novel legal test weakening gun control efforts ? prompting lower courts to invalidate restrictions on ownership by domestic abusers and on guns with serial numbers removed. Key to those victories were appointments of conservative justices by N.R.A.-backed Republican presidents. By the time Antonin Scalia ? author of the Heller opinion ? was nominated by Reagan in 1986, the joke was that the ¡°R¡± in N.R.A. stood for Republican, and internal documents from that era are laced with partisan rhetoric. A 1983 report by a committee of N.R.A. members identified the perceived enemy as liberal elites: ¡°college educated, intellectual, political, educational, legal, religious and also to some extent the business and financial leadership of the country,¡± inordinately affected by the assassinations of ¡°men they admired¡± in the 1960s. Lawmakers joining the board during that time ? Mr. Ashbrook, Mr. Craig and Mr. Stevens ? were all Republicans. Mr. Craig, a conservative gun enthusiast raised in a ranching family, would become ¡°probably the most important¡± point person for the N.R.A. in Congress after Mr. Dingell, said David Keene, a longtime board member and former N.R.A. president. ¡°He was actually like having one of your own guys there,¡± Mr. Keene said in an interview. He added, however, that a legislator need not have been a board member to be supportive of the group¡¯s ambitions. Mr. Craig did not respond to requests for comment, and Mr. Ashbrook and Mr. Stevens are dead. The N.R.A. did not respond to requests for comment. Mr. Dingell, under increasing pressure as a pro-gun Democrat, faced a reckoning of sorts in 1994, when Congress took up an anti-crime bill that would ban certain semiautomatic rifles classified as assault weapons. He opposed the ban but favored the rest of the legislation. A year earlier, he had angered fellow Democrats by voting against the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, which imposed a background check requirement. This time, after intense lobbying that included urgent calls from President Bill Clinton, Mr. Dingell lent crucial support for the new legislation ? and resigned from the N.R.A. board. His wife, Representative Debbie Dingell, a proponent of stronger gun laws who now occupies his old House seat, said her husband faced a backlash from pro-gun extremists that left him deeply disturbed. ¡°He had to have police protection for several months,¡± Ms. Dingell said in an interview. ¡°We had people scream and yell at us. It was the first time I had seen that real hate.¡± Despite voting for the ban, Mr. Dingell almost immediately explored getting it overturned. Notes from 1995 show his staff weighing support for a repeal proposal, conceding that ¡°a solid explanation will have to be made to the majority of our voters who favor gun control.¡± Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold were too young to legally purchase a firearm, so in November 1998 they enlisted an 18-year-old friend to visit a gun show in Colorado and buy them two shotguns and a rifle. Five months later, they used the weapons, along with an illegally obtained handgun, to kill 12 students and one teacher at Columbine High School. The massacre was a turning point for a country not yet numbed to mass shootings and for the N.R.A., criticized for pressing ahead about a week later with plans for its convention just miles from Columbine. That sort of response would be repeated years later, after a teenager killed 19 students and two teachers in Uvalde, Texas, and the N.R.A. went on with its convention in the state shortly afterward. After Columbine, the organization mobilized against a renewed push for gun control. It had a new lawmaker-director to help: Mr. Barr, who had joined the board in 1997. A staunchly conservative lawyer with a libertarian bent, Mr. Barr was among the House Republicans to lead the impeachment of Mr. Clinton. He served on the Judiciary Committee, which has major sway over gun legislation, and proved an eager addition to the N.R.A. leadership. Mr. Barr wrote to another director with a standing offer to use his Capitol Hill office to ensure that any ¡°information you have is cranked into the legislative equation.¡± Mr. Barr¡¯s chief of staff sent the congressman a memo saying the gun group wanted him to review the agenda for a meeting on the ¡°upcoming legislative session¡± and ¡°make any changes or additions.¡± The post-Columbine legislative battle centered on a bill to extend three-day background checks to private sales at gun shows, something the N.R.A. vigorously opposed, saying most weekend shows ended before a check could be completed. In the Senate, Mr. Craig engineered an amendment softening the impact, and Mr. Barr worked the House, earning them praise at an N.R.A. board meeting as ¡°two people that put our best foot forward.¡± The N.R.A. also turned to an old hand: Mr. Dingell. Together, they came up with another amendment that narrowed the gun shows affected and required background checks to be completed in 24 hours or else the sale would go through. Publicly, Mr. Dingell argued that the shortened time window was reasonable. But his papers include notes explaining that while most background checks are done quickly, some take up to three days because the buyer ¡°has been charged with a crime¡± and court records are needed. Gun shows mostly happen on weekends, when courthouses ¡°are, of course, closed.¡± ¡°It is becoming increasingly tougher to make our case that 24 hours is indeed enough time to do the check,¡± a member of Mr. Dingell¡¯s staff wrote to an N.R.A. lobbyist. Nevertheless, Mr. Dingell succeeded in amending the bill. He tried to win over his fellow Democrats with a baldly partisan message: ¡°We¡¯re doing this so that we can become the majority again. Very simply, we need Democrats who can carry the districts where these matters are voting issues.¡± But his colleagues pulled their support. Representative Zoe Lofgren, a California Democrat who fought for the stronger bill, said she believed Mr. Dingell was ¡°trying to make progress, and had, he felt, some credibility with the N.R.A. that might allow him to do that.¡± ¡°Even though what he wanted to do was far from what I wanted to do,¡± she said. At the N.R.A., the collapse of the bill was seen as a victory. An internal report cited Mr. Dingell¡¯s ¡°masterful leadership.¡± A year later the group honored him with a ¡°legislative achievement award.¡± Despite the victories, Mr. Barr saw bigger problems ahead. In memos to Mr. LaPierre in late 1999, he warned that the ¡°entire debate on firearms has shifted¡± and advised holding an ¡°issues summit.¡± Specifically, he pointed to civil lawsuits seeking to hold the firearms industry liable for making and marketing guns used in violent crimes. Gun control advocates saw them as a way around the political stalemate in Washington ? Smith & Wesson, for instance, chose to voluntarily adopt new standards to safeguard children and deter theft. Mr. Barr had introduced a bill that would protect gun companies from such lawsuits, but lamented that ¡°I have received absolutely zero interest, much less support, from the firearms industry.¡± ¡°We can help the industry through our efforts here in the Congress,¡± he wrote. Mr. Craig took up the issue in the Senate, drafting legislation that mirrored Mr. Barr¡¯s House bill. After Mr. Barr lost re-election in 2002, a new version of his liability law was sponsored by others, with N.R.A. guidance. To draw support from moderates, an incentive was added mandating that child safety locks be included when a handgun is sold, but N.R.A. talking points assured allies that the provision ¡°does not require any gun owner to actually use the device.¡± The political climate shifted enough under President George W. Bush and the Republican-controlled Congress that the assault weapons ban of 1994, which had a 10-year limit, was allowed to sunset, and the gun industry¡¯s liability shield finally passed in 2005. The twin developments helped turbocharge the firearms market. The private equity firm Cerberus Capital soon began buying up makers of AR-15 semiautomatic rifles and aggressively marketing them as manhood-affirming accessories, part of a sweeping change in the way military-style weapons were pitched to the public. The number of AR-15-type rifles produced and imported annually would skyrocket from 400,000 in 2006 to 2.8 million by 2020. Asked about his early role in pressing the N.R.A. for help with the liability law, Mr. Barr said he believed the legal threat was significant enough ¡°that the Congress step in.¡± ¡°The rights that are front and center for the N.R.A., the Second Amendment, are very much under attack and need to be defended,¡± Mr. Barr said. ¡°And I defended them both as a member of Congress in that capacity and in my private capacity as a member of the N.R.A. board.¡± With each new mass shooting in the 2000s, pressure built on Congress to act, and the politics of gun rights became more polarized. The N.R.A. lost another of its directors in Congress ? Mr. Craig was arrested for lewd conduct in an airport men¡¯s room and chose not to run again in 2008. But by then, the group¡¯s aggressive use of campaign donations and candidate ¡°report cards¡± had achieved a virtual lock on Republican caucuses. That left Mr. Dingell increasingly marginalized in the gun debate. For a time, his connections were useful to Democrats; in 2007, after the shooting deaths of 32 people at Virginia Tech, he helped secure N.R.A. support to strengthen the collection of mental health records for background checks. But by December 2012, when Adam Lanza, 20, shot to death 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, any vestige of good will between the N.R.A. and Democrats was gone. When House Democrats created a Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, they included the 86-year-old Mr. Dingell as one of 11 vice chairs, but his input was limited. Notes from a task force meeting in January 2013 show that when it was Mr. Dingell¡¯s turn to speak, he joked that he was the ¡°skunk at the picnic¡± who had set up the N.R.A.¡¯s lobbying operation ? the ¡°reason it¡¯s so good.¡± He went on to underscore the rights of hunters and defend the N.R.A., saying it was ¡°not the Devil.¡± A few days earlier, he had privately conferred with N.R.A. representatives. Handwritten notes show that they discussed congressional support for new restrictions and the N.R.A.¡¯s desire to delay legislation: ¡°Need to buy time to put together package can vote for, and get support, also for sensitivities to die down,¡± the notes said. Three months later, a bipartisan gun control proposal failed after implacable resistance from the N.R.A. It was not until June 2022, after the Uvalde shooting, that a major firearms bill was passed ? the first in almost 30 years. The legislation, which had minimal Republican support and fell far short of what Democrats had sought, required more private gun sellers to obtain licenses and perform background checks, and funded state ¡°red flag¡± laws allowing the police to seize firearms from dangerous people. By the time Mr. Dingell retired from the House in 2015, his views on gun policy had evolved, according to his wife, who said he no longer trusted the N.R.A. ¡°I can¡¯t tell you how many nights I heard him talking to people about how the N.R.A. was going too far, how they didn¡¯t understand the times,¡± Ms. Dingell said. ¡°He was a deep believer in the Second Amendment, and at the end he still deeply believed, but he also saw the world was changing.¡± In June 2016, after 49 people were killed in a mass shooting at an Orlando, Fla., nightclub, Ms. Dingell joined fellow Democrats in occupying the House floor as a protest. When she gave a speech, in the middle of the night, she broached the difference of opinion on guns she had with her husband. ¡°You all know how much I love John Dingell. He¡¯s the most important thing in my life,¡± she said. ¡°And yet for 35 years, there¡¯s been a source of tension between the two of us.¡± Mr. Dingell, too, briefly addressed that tension in a memoir published shortly before he died. He recalled that as he watched a recording of his wife¡¯s speech the following morning, ¡°I thought about all the votes I¡¯d taken, all the bills I¡¯d supported,¡± and ¡°whether the gun debate had gotten too polarized.¡± ¡°As Debbie had said with such passion the night before, ¡®Can¡¯t we have a discussion?¡¯¡± he wrote. ¡°And I thought about the role I know I played in contributing to that polarization.¡± Julie Tate contributed research.

By Adam Liptak WASHINGTON ? The Supreme Court on Wednesday refused to block two Illinois laws prohibiting the sale of high-powered guns and high-capacity magazines while challenges to them move forward. The court¡¯s brief order gave no reasons, which is typical when the court acts on requests for emergency relief. There were no noted dissents. Several other states, including California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Washington, along with many municipalities, have enacted similar laws in the wake of mass shootings around the nation. Recent shootings, including one at a Texas mall that left eight people dead, have prompted calls for further efforts to address gun violence. The case that reached the Supreme Court was a challenge to a city ordinance in Naperville, Ill., enacted in August and a state law enacted in January. The ordinance prohibited ¡°the commercial sale of assault rifles,¡± listing 26 categories of weapons, including AK-47 and AR-15 rifles. The state law covered similar weapons along with high-capacity magazines. The National Association for Gun Rights, along with Robert Bevis, who owns a firearms store in Naperville, sued to challenge the laws, saying they violated the Second Amendment. In February, Judge Virginia M. Kendall, of the Federal District Court in Chicago, denied the plaintiffs¡¯ request for a preliminary injunction, saying that the laws were ¡°consistent with the Second Amendment¡¯s text, history and tradition.¡± Judge Kendall, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, acknowledged that the Supreme Court, in striking down a New York law last year that had placed strict limits on gun ownership, had announced a new legal standard for evaluating the constitutionality of gun control laws. She quoted the key passage from Justice Clarence Thomas¡¯s majority opinion in the case, New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen: ¡°When the Second Amendment¡¯s plain text covers an individual¡¯s conduct, the Constitution presumptively protects that conduct. The government must then justify its regulation by demonstrating that it is consistent with the nation¡¯s historical tradition of firearm regulation.¡± After a survey of the historical record, Judge Kendall wrote that ¡°assault weapons pose an exceptional danger, more so than standard self-defense weapons such as handguns¡± and ¡°are used disproportionately in mass shootings, police killings and gang activity.¡± Judge Kendall concluded that ¡°the text of the Second Amendment is limited to only certain arms, and history and tradition demonstrate that particularly ¡®dangerous¡¯ weapons are unprotected.¡± The federal appeals court in Chicago refused to block the laws while an appeal of Judge Kendall¡¯s ruling moves forward. In asking the Supreme Court to intervene, the plaintiffs said that ¡°this is an exceedingly simple case.¡± ¡°The Second Amendment,¡± they wrote, ¡°protects arms that are commonly possessed by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes, especially self-defense in the home.¡± The brief cited a 2015 dissent from Justice Thomas, who said the Supreme Court should not have turned down a petition in a case concerning a ban similar to the one in the new case. ¡°Roughly five million Americans own AR-style semiautomatic rifles,¡± Justice Thomas wrote at the time, referring, he said, to ¡°modern sporting rifles.¡± ¡°The overwhelming majority of citizens who own and use such rifles do so for lawful purposes, including self-defense and target shooting,¡± Justice Thomas wrote. ¡°Under our precedents, that is all that is needed for citizens to have a right under the Second Amendment to keep such weapons.¡± The plaintiffs urged the justices to act quickly, saying that the laws ¡°are literally destroying Mr. Bevis¡¯s livelihood¡± by banning 85 percent of the firearms his store sells. In response, lawyers for Naperville wrote that the prohibited firearms pose exceptional dangers, saying that ¡°criminals who engage in mass shootings overwhelmingly use assault weapons ? not other firearms.¡± In their own brief, state officials told the justices that the features of the prohibited firearms ¡°render them uniquely suitable as weapons of war but not commonly used or suitable for personal self-defense.¡± The historical evidence, the brief said, supported the state law. ¡°During the founding era, Americans typically owned muskets for militia service and fowling pieces to hunt birds and control vermin,¡± the brief said. ¡°Single-shot, muzzle-loading firearms remained the standard weapon up to and including the Civil War.¡± Adam Liptak covers the Supreme Court and writes Sidebar, a column on legal developments.

https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/11/us/louisville-shooting-gunman.html?searchResultPosition=65,2023-04-11,Gunman Who Killed Five in Louisville Left Note and Bought Rifle Legally,"The police released body camera video on Tuesday afternoon from officers who responded to the shooting at a downtown bank. By Kevin Williams,?Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs and Tim Arango LOUISVILLE, Ky. ? The 25-year-old man who opened fire on Monday at a bank in downtown Louisville, killing five people, told at least one person that he was suicidal before the rampage and legally purchased the AR-15-style rifle used in the shooting at a local dealership last week, officials said on Tuesday. ¡°We know he left a note,¡± Representative Morgan McGarvey, a Democrat whose district includes Louisville, said of the gunman at a news conference. ¡°We know he texted or called at least one person to let them know he was suicidal and contemplating harm.¡± Later on Tuesday, the city released body camera footage of the police confrontation. It showed two officers ? a rookie and his training officer ? pulling up in their squad car outside Old National Bank on East Main Street at 8:41 a.m. on Monday, three minutes after receiving reports of shots fired. The gunman, having already shot his victims on the building¡¯s first floor, was waiting inside its glass-strewn lobby to ambush the police, who could not see through the building¡¯s dark windows. The footage, with some graphic portions blurred out, shows a quick initial gun battle, and Officer Nickolas Wilt, who graduated from the police academy weeks earlier, being shot. Taking cover, Officer Cory Galloway, waiting for reinforcements, fires a hail of bullets into the lobby about three minutes after his partner is shot, killing the assailant. ¡°I think he¡¯s down!¡± he yells. ¡°Suspect down, get the officer!¡± In all, nine minutes passed from the first reports of gunfire until the assailant was killed, the police said. Officer Wilt was among four victims who remained hospitalized on Tuesday, said Dr. Jason Smith, the chief medical officer at University of Louisville Health. He was in critical condition after being shot in the head, as was one other victim. Four other people who were wounded were released from the hospital. Another who initially survived the shooting, Deana Eckert, 57, died overnight. The others who were fatally shot, all employees of Old National Bank like Ms. Eckert, were Joshua Barrick, 40; Thomas Elliott, 63; Juliana Farmer, 45; and James Tutt, 64. Mr. Elliott, a vice president at the bank, was a prominent Democratic fund-raiser and close friend to Gov. Andy Beshear of Kentucky. Mayor Craig Greenberg of Louisville, a Democrat, praised the quick response from the Red Cross, which provided 170 units of blood to treat victims on Monday. Noting the enormous amount of blood needed to treat gunshot wounds, Mayor Greenberg urged residents of Louisville to donate blood. And to help the community process the trauma of Monday¡¯s shooting, which the mayor described as an ¡°inexplicable act of violence and cruelty,¡± the city was planning a vigil on Wednesday evening at the Muhammad Ali Center Plaza. The police have identified the gunman as Connor Sturgeon, a University of Alabama graduate who listed his profession as a ¡°syndications associate and portfolio banker¡± at Old National Bank on his LinkedIn page. Mayor Greenberg said he had access to the building because he was ¡°a current employee.¡± As officials dealt with the fallout from the mass shooting on Tuesday, several made emotional pleas to address the gun violence epidemic gripping the country and Louisville, where they said 40 people had died this year in shootings. One person was killed in a separate shooting on Monday, several blocks from Old National Bank. ¡°To be honest with you, we barely had to adjust our operating room schedule to be able to do this,¡± Dr. Smith said of caring for the nine patients the hospital received from the bank shooting. ¡°That¡¯s how frequently we are having to deal with gun violence in our community.¡± With his voice breaking, Dr. Smith, who has worked at the hospital for 15 years, described his job almost as if he were a combat medic in a war zone. ¡°It¡¯s more than tired,¡± he said. ¡°I¡¯m weary. There¡¯s only so many times you can walk into a room and tell someone they are not coming home tomorrow. And it just breaks your heart when you hear someone screaming Mommy or Daddy. It just becomes too hard, day in and day out, to be able to do that.¡± The Louisville Metro Police Department has been under intense scrutiny in recent years after a botched raid in 2020 that killed Breonna Taylor, a Black woman whose death provoked widespread protests; a recent Justice Department report documented entrenched racial bias and misconduct in the Police Department. But the department drew wide praise for its fast response to Monday¡¯s shooting, and it was quick to release the footage that showed it. ¡°Chief, your team was incredible yesterday,¡± Mr. McGarvey said at Tuesday¡¯s news conference, addressing Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel, the interim police chief. ¡°To run headfirst into that gunfire without question saved lives. It also changed lives. Officer Wilt, as we know, is fighting right now after being struck in the head by an AR-15 round on his fourth-ever shift as a police officer.¡± The gunman graduated from Floyd Central High School in Floyds Knobs, Ind., near Louisville, in 2016, and later earned degrees in business and science from the University of Alabama.  People who knew him in high school were ¡°shocked that someone, seemingly so nice and from a typically normal background, could do something so heinously vile,¡± said Madison DeStephanis, a high school classmate. Another former classmate, Chris Harbeson-Borgelt, wrote on Facebook that he was similarly stunned to see that Mr. Sturgeon had become ¡°the monster that murdered innocent lives today.¡± Mr. Sturgeon played varsity basketball in high school under his father, who was the team¡¯s head coach and had previously been the men¡¯s basketball coach at the University of Indianapolis. He had suffered concussions when he was younger that required him to wear protective headgear on the basketball court, according to Brian Glasing, who was Mr. Sturgeon¡¯s gym teacher. Lane Oxley, who coached Mr. Sturgeon on the high school track team, said that he was ¡°one of the leaders of the team by example.¡± The shooting set off a familiar pattern of grief and resignation for a country that has grown accustomed to frequent rampages of gun violence, with politicians offering prayers and expressing outrage and making calls for gun control legislation that will most likely go unrealized. Mr. McGarvey, the only Democrat in Kentucky¡¯s eight-member congressional delegation, called for universal background checks on Tuesday, and measures known as red flag laws that would allow the state to take guns from people believed at risk of harming themselves or others. ¡°We don¡¯t have the tools on the books to deal with someone who is an imminent danger to themselves or to others,¡± he said. Mayor Greenberg implored Kentucky¡¯s political leaders to allow Louisville, a blue bastion in a largely conservative state, to enact its own gun control laws ? especially, he said, if they cared about protecting police officers. ¡°Please, change our state law to let Louisville make its own decisions about reducing the amount of illegal guns on our streets and gun violence that is killing far too many people in mass shootings, in individual shootings, in any shootings,¡± he said. He also angrily denounced a law that allows the state of Kentucky to auction off weapons from shootings to the public after investigations are complete. ¡°Think about that,¡± Mr. Greenberg said, noting that he has ordered his administration to remove firing pins from confiscated weapons before handing them over to the state. ¡°That murder weapon will be back on the streets one day under Kentucky¡¯s current law.¡± Jacey Fortin contributed reporting.

Armed protesters at the Arizona State Capitol in Phoenix on Jan. 6, 2021.Credit...Adriana Zehbrauskas for The New York Times Supported by By Mike McIntire For more audio journalism and storytelling, download New York Times Audio, a new iOS app available for news subscribers. Across the country, openly carrying a gun in public is no longer just an exercise in self-defense ? increasingly it is a soapbox for elevating one¡¯s voice and, just as often, quieting someone else¡¯s. This month, armed protesters appeared outside an elections center in Phoenix, hurling baseless accusations that the election for governor had been stolen from the Republican, Kari Lake. In October, Proud Boys with guns joined a rally in Nashville where conservative lawmakers spoke against transgender medical treatments for minors. In June, armed demonstrations around the United States amounted to nearly one a day. A group led by a former Republican state legislator protested a gay pride event in a public park in Coeur d¡¯Alene, Idaho. Men with guns interrupted a Juneteenth festival in Franklin, Tenn., handing out fliers claiming that white people were being replaced. Among the others were rallies in support of gun rights in Delaware and abortion rights in Georgia. Whether at the local library, in a park or on Main Street, most of these incidents happen where Republicans have fought to expand the ability to bear arms in public, a movement bolstered by a recent Supreme Court ruling on the right to carry firearms outside the home. The loosening of limits has occurred as violent political rhetoric rises and the police in some places fear bloodshed among an armed populace on a hair trigger. But the effects of more guns in public spaces have not been evenly felt. A partisan divide ? with Democrats largely eschewing firearms and Republicans embracing them ? has warped civic discourse. Deploying the Second Amendment in service of the First has become a way to buttress a policy argument, a sort of silent, if intimidating, bullhorn. ¡°It¡¯s disappointing we¡¯ve gotten to that state in our country,¡± said Kevin Thompson, executive director of the Museum of Science & History in Memphis, Tenn., where armed protesters led to the cancellation of an L.G.B.T.Q. event in September. ¡°What I saw was a group of folks who did not want to engage in any sort of dialogue and just wanted to impose their belief.¡± A New York Times analysis of more than 700 armed demonstrations found that, at about 77 percent of them, people openly carrying guns represented right-wing views, such as opposition to L.G.B.T.Q. rights and abortion access, hostility to racial justice rallies and support for former President Donald J. Trump¡¯s lie of winning the 2020 election. The records, from January 2020 to last week, were compiled by the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, a nonprofit that tracks political violence around the world. The Times also interviewed witnesses to other, smaller-scale incidents not captured by the data, including encounters with armed people at indoor public meetings. Anti-government militias and right-wing culture warriors like the Proud Boys attended a majority of the protests, the data showed. Violence broke out at more than 100 events and often involved fisticuffs with opposing groups, including left-wing activists such as antifa. Republican politicians are generally more tolerant of openly armed supporters than are Democrats, who are more likely to be on the opposing side of people with guns, the records suggest. In July, for example, men wearing sidearms confronted Beto O¡¯Rourke, then the Democratic candidate for Texas governor, at a campaign stop in Whitesboro and warned that he was ¡°not welcome in this town.¡± Republican officials or candidates appeared at 32 protests where they were on the same side as those with guns. Democratic politicians were identified at only two protests taking the same view as those armed.  Sometimes, the Republican officials carried weapons: Robert Sutherland, a Washington state representative, wore a pistol on his hip while protesting Covid-19 restrictions in Olympia in 2020. ¡°Governor,¡± he said, speaking to a crowd, ¡°you send men with guns after us for going fishing. We¡¯ll see what a revolution looks like.¡± The occasional appearance of armed civilians at demonstrations or governmental functions is not new. In the 1960s, the Black Panthers displayed guns in public when protesting police brutality. Militia groups, sometimes armed, rallied against federal agents involved in violent standoffs at Ruby Ridge and Waco in the 1990s. But the frequency of these incidents exploded in 2020, with conservative pushback against public health measures to fight the coronavirus and response to the sometimes violent rallies after the murder of George Floyd. Today, in some parts of the country with permissive gun laws, it is not unusual to see people with handguns or military-style rifles at all types of protests. For instance, at least 14 such incidents have occurred in and around Dallas and Phoenix since May, including outside an F.B.I. field office to condemn the search of Mr. Trump¡¯s home and, elsewhere, in support of abortion rights. In New York and Washington, where gun laws are strict, there were none ? even though numerous demonstrations took place during that same period. Many conservatives and gun-rights advocates envision virtually no limits. When Democrats in Colorado and Washington State passed laws this year prohibiting firearms at polling places and government meetings, Republicans voted against them. Indeed, those bills were the exception. Attempts by Democrats to impose limits in other states have mostly failed, and some form of open carry without a permit is now legal in 38 states, a number that is likely to expand as legislation advances in several more. In Michigan, where a Tea Party group recently advertised poll-watcher training using a photo of armed men in camouflage, judges have rejected efforts to prohibit guns at voting locations. Gun rights advocates assert that banning guns from protests would violate the right to carry firearms for self-defense. Jordan Stein, a spokesman for Gun Owners of America, pointed to Kyle Rittenhouse, the teenager acquitted last year in the shooting of three people during a chaotic demonstration in Kenosha, Wis., where he had walked the streets with a military-style rifle. ¡°At a time when protests often devolve into riots, honest people need a means to protect themselves,¡± he said. Beyond self-defense, Mr. Stein said the freedom of speech and the right to have a gun are ¡°bedrock principles¡± and that ¡°Americans should be able to bear arms while exercising their First Amendment rights, whether that¡¯s going to church or a peaceful assembly.¡± Others argue that openly carrying firearms at public gatherings, particularly when there is no obvious self-defense reason, can have a corrosive effect, leading to curtailed activities, suppressed opinions or public servants who quit out of fear and frustration.  Concerned about armed protesters, local election officials in Arizona, Colorado and Oregon have requested bulletproofing for their offices.  Adam Searing, a lawyer and Georgetown University professor who helps families secure access to health care, said he saw the impact on free speech when people objecting to Covid restrictions used guns to make their point. In some states, disability rights advocates were afraid to show up to support mask mandates because of armed opposition, Mr. Searing said. ¡°What was really disturbing was the guns became kind of a signifier for political reasons,¡± he said, adding, ¡°It was just about pure intimidation.¡± The Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project has been tracking such incidents in the United States for the past few years. Events captured by the data are not assigned ideological labels but include descriptions, and are collected from news sources, social media and independent partners like the Network Contagion Research Institute, which monitors extremism and disinformation online. The Times¡¯s analysis found that the largest drivers of armed demonstrations have shifted since 2020. This year, protesters with guns are more likely to be motivated by abortion or L.G.B.T.Q. issues. Sam Jones, a spokesman for the nonpartisan data group, said that upticks in armed incidents tended to correspond to ¡°different flash-point events and time periods, like the Roe v. Wade decision and Pride Month.¡± In about a quarter of the cases, left-wing activists also were armed. Many times it was a response, they said, to right-wing intimidation. Other times it was not, such as when about 40 demonstrators, some with rifles, blocked city officials in Dallas from clearing a homeless encampment in July. More than half of all armed protests occurred in 10 states with expansive open-carry laws: Arizona, Georgia, Kentucky, Michigan, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia and Washington. Three of them ? Michigan, Oregon and Texas ? allowed armed protesters to gather outside capitol buildings ahead of President Biden¡¯s inauguration, and in Michigan, militia members carrying assault rifles were permitted inside the capitol during protests against Covid lockdowns. Beyond the mass gatherings, there are everyday episodes of armed intimidation. Kimber Glidden had been director of the Boundary County Library in Northern Idaho for a couple of months when some parents began raising questions in February about books they believed were inappropriate for children. It did not matter that the library did not have most of those books ? largely dealing with gender, sexuality and race ? or that those it did have were not in the children¡¯s section. The issue became a cause c?l?bre for conservative activists, some of whom began showing up with guns to increasingly tense public meetings, Ms. Glidden said. ¡°How do you stand there and tell me you want to protect children when you¡¯re in the children¡¯s section of the library and you¡¯re armed?¡± she asked. In August, she resigned, decrying the ¡°intimidation tactics and threatening behavior.¡± At a Second Amendment rally in June 2021 outside the statehouse in Harrisburg, Pa., where some people were armed, Republican speakers repeatedly connected the right to carry a gun to other social and cultural issues. Representative Scott Perry voiced a frequent conservative complaint about censorship, saying the First Amendment was ¡°under assault.¡± ¡°And you know very well what protects the First,¡± he said. ¡°Which is what we¡¯re doing here today.¡± Stephanie Borowicz, a state legislator, was more blunt, boasting to the crowd that ¡°tyrannical governors¡± had been forced to ease coronavirus restrictions because ¡°as long as we¡¯re an armed population, the government fears us.¡± Pennsylvania, like some other states with permissive open-carry laws, is home to right-wing militias that sometimes appear in public with firearms. They are often welcomed, or at least accepted, by Republican politicians. When a dozen militia members, some wearing skull masks and body armor, joined a protest against Covid restrictions in Pittsburgh in April 2020, Jeff Neff, a Republican borough council president running for the state senate, posed for a photo with the group. In it, he is holding his campaign sign, surrounded by men with military-style rifles. In an email, Mr. Neff said he had since left politics, and expressed regret over past news coverage of the photo, adding, ¡°Please know that I do not condone any threats or action of violence by any person or groups.¡± Across the country, there is evidence of increasing Republican involvement in militias. A membership list for the Oath Keepers, made public last year, includes 81 elected officials or candidates, according to a report by the Anti-Defamation League. Most of them appear to be Republicans. Another nationwide militia, the American Patriots Three Percent, recently told prospective members that it worked to support ¡°individuals seeking election to local G.O.P. boards,¡± according to an archived version of its website. More than 25 members of the Oath Keepers and Three Percenters have been charged in the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. Those organizations, along with the Proud Boys and Boogaloo Boys, make up the bulk of organized groups in the armed-protest data, according to The Times¡¯s analysis. Shootings were rare, such as when a Proud Boy was shot in the foot while chasing antifa members during a protest over Covid lockdowns in Olympia last year. But Mr. Jones said the data, which also tracked unarmed demonstrations, showed that while armed protests accounted for less than 2 percent of the total, they were responsible for 10 percent of those where violence occurred, most often involving fights between rival groups.  ¡°Armed groups or individuals might say they have no intention of intimidating anyone and are only participating in demonstrations to keep the peace,¡± said Mr. Jones, ¡°but the evidence doesn¡¯t back up the claim.¡± In a landmark 2008 decision in District of Columbia v. Heller, the Supreme Court held that the Second Amendment conveyed a basic right to bear arms for lawful purposes such as self-defense at home. It went further in a decision this June that struck down New York restrictions on concealed-pistol permits, effectively finding a right to carry firearms in public. But the court in Heller also made clear that gun rights were not unlimited, and that its ruling did not invalidate laws prohibiting ¡°the carrying of firearms in sensitive places.¡± That caveat was reiterated in a concurring opinion in the New York case. Even some hard-line gun rights advocates are uncomfortable with armed people at public protests. Alan Gottlieb, founder of the Second Amendment Foundation, told The Washington Times in 2017 that ¡°if you are carrying it to make a political point, we are not going to support that.¡± ¡°Firearms serve a purpose,¡± he said, ¡°and the purpose is not a mouthpiece.¡±  But groups that embrace Second Amendment absolutism do not hesitate to criticize fellow advocates who stray from that orthodoxy.  After Dan Crenshaw, a Republican congressman from Texas and former Navy SEAL, lamented in 2020 that ¡°guys dressing up in their Call of Duty outfits, marching through the streets,¡± were not advancing the cause of gun rights, he was knocked by the Firearms Policy Coalition for ¡°being critical of people exercising their right to protest.¡± The coalition has fought state laws that it says force gun owners to choose between the rights to free speech and self-defense. Regardless of whether there is a right to go armed in public for self-defense, early laws and court decisions made clear that the Constitution did not empower people, such as modern-day militia members, to gather with guns as a form of protest, said Michael C. Dorf, a constitutional law professor at Cornell University who has written about the tension between the rights to free speech and guns. Mr. Dorf pointed to an 18th-century Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruling that a group of protesters with firearms had no right to rally in public against a government tax. Some states also adopted an old English law prohibiting ¡°going armed to the terror of the people,¡± still on the books in some places, aimed at preventing the use of weapons to threaten or intimidate. ¡°Historically,¡± said Mr. Dorf, ¡°there were such limits on armed gatherings, even assuming that there¡¯s some right to be armed as individuals.¡± More broadly, there is no evidence that the framers of the Constitution intended for Americans to take up arms during civic debate among themselves ? or to intimidate those with differing opinions. That is what happened at the Memphis museum in September, when people with guns showed up to protest a scheduled dance party that capped a summer-long series on the history of the L.G.B.T.Q. community in the South. While the party was billed as ¡°family friendly,¡± conservatives on local talk radio claimed that children would be at risk (the museum said the planned activities were acceptable for all ages). As armed men wearing masks milled about outside, the panicked staff canceled all programs and evacuated the premises.  Mr. Thompson, the director, said he and his board were now grappling with the laws on carrying firearms, which were loosened last year by state legislators.  ¡°It¡¯s a different time,¡± he said, ¡°and it¡¯s something we have to learn to navigate.¡± Allie Pitchon contributed reporting.

She has since built a powerful advocacy group.

WASHINGTON ? Twelve years after a?bullet ripped through the left side of her brain, Gabrielle Giffords speaks mainly in stock phrases and short bursts, conveying meaning with her eyes or a boxer¡¯s swing of her left arm, the one that is still fully mobile. ¡°Enough is enough!¡± she might say. Or: ¡°Be passionate! Be courageous!¡± But in an interview at the headquarters of the gun safety group that bears her name, amid a string of mass shootings in California, there was something more that Ms. Giffords wanted to say. Asked what Americans should know about her, she closed her eyes and rocked slowly back and forth, as if to summon words from deep within. She shushed a colleague who tried to speak for her. And then she delivered a speech unlike any she had given as a congresswoman from Arizona, before the 2011 mass shooting that nearly killed her. ¡°I¡¯m getting better,¡± she said haltingly, laboring over each word. ¡°Slowly, I¡¯m getting better. Long, hard haul, but I¡¯m getting better. Our lives can change so quickly. Mine did when I was shot. I¡¯ve never given up hope. I chose to make a new start, to move ahead, to not look back. I¡¯m relearning so many things ? how to walk, how to talk ? and I¡¯m fighting to make the country safer. It can be so difficult. Losses hurt; setbacks are hard. But I tell myself: Move ahead.¡± Ms. Giffords, 52, who goes by Gabby, is arguably America¡¯s most famous gun violence survivor. She had come to the group¡¯s headquarters in Washington for an update and a strategy session. The timing of her visit underscored two competing truths: The gun safety movement she helps lead is stronger than ever. But the nation¡¯s gun violence epidemic is worsening. In part because of the efforts of Giffords, the group Ms. Giffords and her husband founded 10 years ago, so-called red flag laws aimed at keeping guns away from potentially dangerous people have now been enacted in 19 states and the District of Columbia; states adopted dozens of?new gun safety laws in 2022 alone. Breaking nearly 30 years of partisan gridlock, Congress passed a modest package of gun safety measures last year. Democrats, who once feared the gun rights lobby, are now running on gun safety platforms. But already this year, 84 people have died in 49 mass shootings, according to the Gun Violence Archive, which defines mass shootings as those in which four or more people are shot or killed. A divided Congress means there is little hope for ambitious reforms in Washington. The Supreme Court, now with a six-justice conservative majority, ruled?last year that Americans have a broad right to carry guns, making it harder for states to impose restrictions. Ghost guns ? untraceable firearms assembled from components bought online ? are proliferating. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calls firearm deaths ¡°a significant and growing public health problem.¡± In 2021, 81 percent of homicides and 55 percent of suicides involved guns. ¡°Without the laws we¡¯ve passed, even more people would be dead,¡± said Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, who led the push for last year¡¯s package of gun safety measures. ¡°But right now, we¡¯re losing the race. We¡¯re passing laws at a quick rate, but not fast enough to keep up with the pace of new weapons in communities and in homes.¡± Ms. Giffords is an optimist, but also a realist. In written answers to questions ? an accommodation she sought because conversation is difficult ? she conceded that persuading Congress to pass sweeping laws, like banning assault weapons or requiring gun manufacturers to make weapons with safety devices like fingerprint locks, ¡°will be tough.¡± But she likened the effort to her own painstaking recovery ? a fight back that will never get her where she once was. ¡°Progress,¡± she said, ¡°happens inch by inch.¡± Each day in the United States, upward of 200 people are wounded by guns and more than 110 are killed, according to Everytown for Gun Safety, another advocacy group, which has declared the first week in February as National Gun Violence Survivors Week. The figures include suicides, homicides, accidents and police shootings. Keenon James, who runs the group¡¯s survivor network, is among millions of Americans touched by gun violence; his older brother was shot and killed in 1993. He said Ms. Giffords had put a powerful spotlight on the experiences of survivors. ¡°She is absolutely a symbol of resilience,¡± he said. ¡°That experience may have changed her, but it has not stopped her.¡± One thing it did stop, however, is her political career. Her husband, the former astronaut Mark Kelly, is now a Democratic senator from Arizona, a job to which she once aspired. In Congress, Ms. Giffords was a centrist Democrat who opposed the death penalty but supported gun rights. She owned a 9-millimeter Glock to protect herself after two home burglaries. In recent years, her group has sought to enlist gun owners; eight states now have chapters of Gun Owners for Safety, a Giffords initiative. In a sign of the political realities she faces, Ms. Giffords¡¯s home state of Arizona is not among them. The state does not have a red flag law and allows people 21 or older to carry a concealed, loaded firearm in public without a permit. Mr. Kelly said it would be a ¡°tough proposition¡± to get gun safety measures through the State Legislature. And he has not been especially vocal about gun safety as a senator. ¡°My style on this stuff is to show up and do the work here,¡± he said last week during an interview in his Senate office, ¡°not be on TV talking about it.¡± Two major gun rights groups, the National Rifle Association and Gun Owners of America, did not respond to requests for comment. On a Saturday morning in January 2011, Ms. Giffords was greeting constituents at a ¡°Congress on Your Corner¡± event outside a Safeway supermarket in Tucson when a gunman shot her at point-blank range?before turning on the crowd. The authorities later found evidence of his plan to assassinate her. Six people died, including a federal judge, an aide to Ms. Giffords and a 9-year-old girl. Thirteen were wounded, including Ms. Giffords. Ms. Giffords¡¯s own injuries were so grievous that early news reports pronounced her dead. Mr. Kelly, in Houston preparing for a space mission, rushed to the hospital in Tucson to find his wife comatose. Her doctors, he said, ¡°couldn¡¯t give me any guarantee that she¡¯d ever come out of the coma, or what her condition would be.¡± The shooting left Ms. Giffords partially paralyzed on her right side; today, after years of occupational and physical therapy, she wears a leg brace and can walk, though she often uses a cane. She can lift her right arm almost shoulder high and wiggle her fingers. She can ride a recumbent bike, is learning to write with her left hand and is relearning how to play the French horn. She can still sing certain songs, word for word. But because the bullet destroyed neurons in the part of the brain that controls language, it robbed Ms. Giffords of a prized tool for politicians: the ability to speak fluently. Those who know her best ? including Fabi Hirsch, her speech pathologist ? say that does not mean she cannot communicate. She just gets her message across differently than before. In medical terms, Ms. Giffords suffers from aphasia, a language disorder that Dr. Hirsch said affects her ability to speak and understand spoken words, as well as read and write. But her intellect and cognitive ability are intact, Dr. Hirsch said. Ms. Giffords spent six months after the shooting at a rehabilitation hospital in Houston. With her head shaved and stitches across her skull where surgeons had removed a chunk of it, she was required to wear a helmet, which she ¡°hated,¡± she said. During speech therapy, she often got stuck on a single word ? a phenomenon called ¡°perseveration,¡± Dr. Hirsch said. For Ms. Giffords, the word was chicken. ¡°Chicken, chicken, chicken,¡± she would repeat, over and over again. She resigned her House seat in early 2012. Later that year, a gunman went on a rampage at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., killing 20 children and six staff members. That was the impetus for the founding of Giffords, originally called Americans for Responsible Solutions, in January 2013. Everytown was also founded in 2013, when two other gun safety groups ? Mayors Against Illegal Guns and Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America ? merged. The movement was not especially sophisticated before Sandy Hook, said Josh Horwitz, who worked for and later ran the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence for nearly 30 years before joining the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Giffords and Everytown, he said, employed a ¡°political campaign approach,¡± harnessing online fund-raising and social media in a way that enabled gun safety activists to finally compete with the National Rifle Association. ¡°The N.R.A. had this competitive advantage because they had all these gun stores and gun shows recruiting for them every day ? ¡®Join the N.R.A.!¡¯¡± he said. ¡°And for the first time, we were able to go head-to-head with them, collecting new members.¡± But the fallout from Sandy Hook did not result in new gun safety laws at the federal level. And the package of gun safety measures passed by Congress last year received mixed reviews from experts. Lawrence O. Gostin, an expert in public health law at Georgetown University, called it ¡°weak sauce and window dressing,¡± adding that he feared Ms. Giffords would never win her fight. ¡°It¡¯s not winnable in her lifetime, and I say that with enormous tears in my eyes,¡± he said. ¡°It is getting worse, because we¡¯re becoming completely numb to it, and there¡¯s a certain inevitability to mass shootings that we think is unfixable. And once you think it¡¯s unfixable, it is unfixable.¡± Ms. Giffords refuses to think that way. She is relentlessly upbeat and extremely busy; accompanied by a medical assistant, she spends about half her time traveling, raising awareness and money to help elect like-minded political candidates and to support Giffords. The organization includes an advocacy arm, a law center based in San Francisco and a political action committee. It has about 70 paid staff members and a $30 million annual budget, said Peter Ambler, its executive director. Her home base is still Tucson, where she and a family friend joined with Dr. Hirsch to found a nonprofit called Friends of Aphasia to provide support and treatment to those with the disorder, which affects about two million Americans. (The group¡¯s tagline: ¡°Let¡¯s get people talking.¡±) When she is in town, she works with Dr. Hirsch three days a week. Some things have not changed. Ms. Giffords and Mr. Kelly still have a ¡°commuter marriage,¡± he said. She is still a hugger ? maybe even more so now. When she arrived at the Giffords headquarters last week, she hugged nearly every person in the room. She still enjoys the spotlight. She was grand marshal of the Rose Parade in Pasadena, Calif., this month. She does yoga twice a week and is taking Spanish lessons; she was once fluent in the language. She went skydiving on the third anniversary of the shooting. In November 2021, after two years of study, she celebrated her bat mitzvah; her great-grandfather was a Lithuanian rabbi, and she wanted to get in touch with her Jewish roots. Last year, she was the subject of a poignant documentary that chronicled her comeback. The film included footage that Mr. Kelly asked a friend to record in the days and weeks after she was wounded. In the interview, Ms. Giffords said it was not hard for her to look at those images. ¡°Move ahead,¡± she said. ¡°Do not look back.¡± Asked what message she has for the people she meets, she said: ¡°Forgiveness. Forgiveness.¡± She was asked: Why forgiveness? ¡°Shooting. Shooting. Shooting. Shooting,¡± she said. Her meaning was clear: She has forgiven her shooter. ¡°Yes, yes, yes,¡± she said, when asked if that was what she meant. Aphasia remains her biggest challenge. To make the most of her public appearances, she practices speaking, word by word by word. For the interview, a public relations representative provided The New York Times with a list of questions she had practiced answering. Typically, those answers consisted of a short sentence or two. But during the conversation, Ms. Giffords also answered unscripted questions, including the one that prompted her brief, moving speech. Ms. Giffords had been practicing that speech for ¡°months and months,¡± Dr. Hirsch said, adding that she was ¡°thrilled¡± to hear that Ms. Giffords had ¡°used it in a more spontaneous context.¡± It ended like this: ¡°I¡¯m finding joy in small things: riding my bike, playing the French horn, going to the gym, laughing with friends. The small things add up! We are living in challenging times, but we are up for the challenge.¡± She continued on in that vein, before ending with a rousing ¡°Amen!¡± Audio produced by Jack D¡¯Isidoro.

https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/10/us/politics/roland-gutierrez-texas-ted-cruz.html?searchResultPosition=68,2023-07-10,"State Senator Roland Gutierrez Seeks to Unseat Ted Cruz, Widening Democratic Field","The state senator, who represents Uvalde, Texas, vowed to make his passionate appeals for gun control a centerpiece of his campaign. By J. David Goodman Reporting from Houston Roland Gutierrez, a Democratic state senator who has been an outspoken gun-control proponent since last year¡¯s massacre in Uvalde, Texas, announced on Monday that he would seek Senator Ted Cruz¡¯s seat next year. Mr. Gutierrez, whose district stretches from San Antonio to the Rio Grande and includes Uvalde, is the second major Democratic politician to enter the race, most likely ensuring a high-profile primary contest among Texas Democrats. Representative Colin Allred, a second-term congressman from the Dallas area, declared his candidacy in May. Both candidates have entered the race vowing to focus their attacks on Mr. Cruz rather than on any Democratic rivals. Mr. Gutierrez gained a measure of national prominence as one of the most strident and uncompromising voices in the Texas Capitol pressing for gun control after the massacre that killed 19 children and two teachers at Robb Elementary in Uvalde last May. He is a familiar face on cable news, commenting not only on the killings in Uvalde and the delayed police response but also on other mass shootings. ¡°I¡¯m a proud gun owner and believer in the Second Amendment, but after 19 children and two teachers died, the Republicans wouldn¡¯t even allow us an opportunity to talk about ways to protect our kids,¡± Mr. Gutierrez says in a video published on Monday to announce his candidacy. ¡°It¡¯s why we have to do something now.¡± The issue of gun violence, and the unwillingness of Texas Republicans in the state and at the federal level to regulate guns, is expected to be a centerpiece of Mr. Gutierrez¡¯s campaign. Aides said that Mr. Gutierrez would not be afraid to show his passion on the issue, as he has done during news conferences and on television. ¡°There is a special place in hell for people who have this kind of problem staring them square in the face and have done nothing about it,¡± Mr. Gutierrez said in May, after a gunman killed eight people and wounded seven others at a mall north of Dallas. Unlike Mr. Allred, who began his campaign in part by presenting himself as a bipartisan politician, Mr. Gutierrez is gambling that a much more combative and potentially polarizing approach will provide a path to unseating Mr. Cruz and winning statewide office in Texas. Democrats have not done so in decades. As a state senator, Mr. Gutierrez pressed for a range of measures to add restrictions to gun purchases, including raising the age to buy AR-15-style rifles and expanding background checks, which polls have shown are broadly popular in Texas. None of the bills passed the Republican-dominated Legislature. Beto O¡¯Rourke, the former El Paso congressman, supported the same set of gun control policies during his unsuccessful campaign for governor last year. Mr. Gutierrez is betting that the message would resonate differently coming from someone with his personal biography, a gun-owning Hispanic representative from a largely rural district of South Texas. Mr. O¡¯Rourke also challenged Mr. Cruz, in 2018, and narrowly lost. Mr. Gutierrez¡¯s aides said that the massacre in Uvalde would serve as the prime example of how low-income and working Texans were being mistreated by those in power like Mr. Cruz. ¡°Texans will now get to watch Colin Allred and Roland Gutierrez slug it out for who can be the most radical leftist in the state,¡± said Nick Maddux, a spokesman for Mr. Cruz. ¡°Meanwhile, Senator Cruz will continue passionately defending Texas and delivering real results for 30 million Texans.¡± Mr. Gutierrez begins with a fund-raising disadvantage. Mr. Allred¡¯s campaign said that it had raised $6.2 million in the two months since announcing his campaign. Mr. Gutierrez, by contrast, was prevented by Texas law from raising money until mid-June, after the end of the state¡¯s legislative session. But aides to Mr. Gutierrez said that they did not anticipate that fund-raising would be a problem, especially in a general election, because Democrats have traditionally been willing and eager to spend money to try to defeat Mr. Cruz.

https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/25/us/walmart-shooting-death-note.html?searchResultPosition=69,2022-11-25,Walmart Gunman Bought Pistol Hours Before Killing and Left a ¡®Death Note¡¯,"A message found by the police on the killer¡¯s phone asked God to forgive him for targeting co-workers, whose deaths were the latest in a string of mass shooting fatalities. By J. David Goodman The Walmart supervisor who shot and killed six of his co-workers at a store in Chesapeake, Va., this week purchased a pistol only hours before the massacre and left a note on his phone, in which he described planning to target some colleagues and spare others, according to new details released on Friday. With loved ones of the victims continuing to mourn and a candlelight vigil planned by the city on Monday, the note provided the first indication of what led to the eruption of workplace violence on Tuesday night in a Walmart break room, where members of what has been described as a close-knit overnight team were gunned down. As with a seemingly endless series of recent mass shootings across the country ? through a Raleigh, N.C., neighborhood, at an Indiana mall¡¯s food court, inside a Colorado nightclub ? the employee¡¯s ability to purchase the weapon and quickly use it provided yet another grim data point in the nation¡¯s ongoing tug of war over gun violence. President Biden, speaking to reporters on Thanksgiving Day, said he would press for new restrictions in Congress, particularly on military-style rifles.  Asked whether he could do anything about gun violence before Republicans take power in the House of Representatives next year, Mr. Biden said, ¡°I¡¯m going to try. I¡¯m going to try to get rid of assault weapons.¡± While such weapons have figured into several mass shootings in recent months, including at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, and in a grocery store in Buffalo, N.Y., the gunman in the Chesapeake Walmart opened fire with a newly acquired 9-millimeter handgun.  ¡°The gun was legally purchased from a local store on the morning of Tuesday,¡± Chesapeake city officials said in a statement, adding that the gunman ¡°had no criminal history.¡± The police found a box of ammunition as well as a receipt and other paperwork related to the purchase of the gun, the city said. Officials did not say where the gunman had bought the weapon. The police also said an analysis of a phone belonging to the gunman, identified as Andre Bing, 31, turned up a message that he called a ¡°death note,¡± in which he said employees at the store had mocked him and compared him to a serial killer. The phone was found at the scene, officials said when posting the message on Twitter. In the message, the gunman said he would not kill an employee who had cancer because the gunman¡¯s mother had died from the disease. ¡°My God forgive me for what I¡¯m going to do¡¦¡± the note ended. Officials said that investigators were still trying to determine when the note had been written. The massacre at the Chesapeake Walmart was the second high-profile mass shooting in the state in less than two weeks. Earlier this month, a student at the University of Virginia shot and killed three members of the school¡¯s football team on a bus after a class trip. ¡°Too many families will have an empty seat at their tables at Thanksgiving and Christmas,¡± said the State Senator L. Louise Lucas, a senior leader in the Virginia legislature. ¡°My thoughts and prayers are with those families, but my actions will be working tirelessly to fix our gun laws until we stop this violence.¡± Democrats in Virginia have enacted several new restrictions on gun purchases in recent years, including universal background checks. But based on the information that officials have released, it did not appear that any of the regulations would have applied to the Walmart gunman. Like most states, Virginia does not require a waiting period for firearm purchases.  Republicans in Virginia, who now control the House of Delegates, have not indicated interest in pursuing further regulations, and Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, has said that if his party took control of the State Senate as well, he would back a repeal of some of the restrictions put in place by Democrats.  In the aftermath of the Walmart shooting, Mr. Youngkin said Wednesday that it was too early at that point to begin talking about what policies should be pursued in response to the recent violence.  ¡°The investigation at the University of Virginia and this investigation are still active. We want to gather all the facts, and then make good decisions,¡± the governor said. A spokesman for the governor did not add anything beyond those comments on Friday.   Gun control advocates pointed to policies that they said could reduce impulsive shootings of the sort that appeared to have occurred in Chesapeake and at Atlanta-area massage businesses in 2021, such as licensing requirements or waiting periods for purchasing. ¡°Waiting periods can meaningfully reduce gun suicides and homicides,¡± said Allison Anderman, senior counsel and director of local policy at Giffords, which advocates for stricter gun laws. ¡°If there is a mandatory period for people to reconsider their actions, they may consider a different course. But being able to acquire a very lethal form of killing when they¡¯re in a period of crisis is not a good idea.¡± Messages seeking comment from the National Rifle Association and Gun Owners of America were not immediately returned. The N.R.A., on its website, calls waiting periods ¡°arbitrary impositions¡± that do not impede crime or suicide. According to a witness, the Walmart gunman opened fire without warning after entering the break room where his co-workers had gathered as their 10 p.m. shift began. The first call came to the police at 10:12 p.m., and officers entered the store about four minutes later, the authorities said. By that point, the gunman was already dead from what the police have said was an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound. The victims included several employees who had worked with him for years ? Randall Blevins, Lorenzo Gamble and Brian Pendleton ? and others who had more recently joined the staff, including Kellie Pyle and Tyneka Johnson. One victim was a 16-year-old boy identified on Friday by the authorities as Fernando Chavez-Barron. Two people injured in the shooting remained hospitalized on Friday, including one in critical condition, officials said.  Former co-workers said the overnight team at the store had formed a close relationship but also recalled that Mr. Bing, as a supervisor, displayed some off-putting behavior. One former employee said that he could be aggressive. Another described him as ¡°a loner.¡±  Shaundrayia Reese, 27, who had worked on the overnight crew, said that some on the team ¡°did complain to the managers about Andre¡¯s behavior.¡± The note attributed to the gunman indicated a belief that at least one of his co-workers, whose names were redacted by the police, had been ¡°trying to get rid of me since day one¡± and that his phone had been ¡°hacked.¡± The note included several references to God, the Holy Spirit and Satan and suggested that the gunman had been concerned about having ¡°social deficits¡± since he was a child.   In a statement in response to the release of the note, Walmart said on Friday that ¡°there is nothing that can justify taking innocent lives.¡±  J.

By Maggie Astor To find the statistics in this article, Maggie Astor examined more than 900 National Rifle Association ratings. She has performed similar analyses of N.R.A. grades assigned since 2008. The Democratic break from the National Rifle Association is complete: For the first time in at least 25 years, not a single Democrat running for Congress anywhere in the country received an A in the group¡¯s candidate ratings, which were once a powerful influence in U.S. elections. A New York Times analysis of the N.R.A.¡¯s letter grades for more than 900 general election candidates, the last of which were published this week, identified the milestone. It is the culmination of a yearslong trend of eroding support for the hard-line views of the organization, which retains strong allegiance from Republican candidates but has lost any semblance of bipartisan support. Of the more than 450 Democrats who will be on House or Senate ballots in November, only one, Representative Jared Golden of Maine, received even a B. Three received C¡¯s, 23 received D¡¯s and 370 ? 81 percent of the total ? received F¡¯s. (The rest received a ¡°?¡± rating, meaning they had no public record on gun policy or had made contradictory statements.) The numbers were even starker among the roughly 200 Democrats running for re-election, 98 percent of whom received F¡¯s. There were more defections from the party line among Republicans, though they were still in the single digits: One, Representative Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, received an F, and seven, including four incumbents, received D¡¯s. Notably, 24 percent of Republican candidates received a ¡°?¡± rating, a mark the N.R.A. says ¡°often indicates indifference, if not outright hostility,¡± to gun rights. That amount has increased sharply among Republicans; it was 11 percent a decade ago. By contrast, ¡°?¡± grades among Democrats declined over the same period to 13 percent from 33 percent. Many Democrats used to avoid going on the record about guns out of fear of the N.R.A.¡¯s well-funded backlash. All told, of 926 major-party candidates on House and Senate ballots this year, 36 percent received A¡¯s and 40 percent received F¡¯s, making 2022 the third election in a row in which the N.R.A. assigned more F¡¯s than A¡¯s. While Republicans have always supported the N.R.A. in larger numbers, it was not long ago that the group also had meaningful Democratic backing: In 2012, 70 Democrats running for the House or Senate received A¡¯s. That is now unheard-of. The last Democratic incumbent with an A rating was Collin Peterson of Minnesota in 2020, when he lost re-election. Most incumbents received the same grade this year as the last time they ran, which is typical. Only 14 saw their grades change, seven in each direction. Almost all of those incumbents were Republican: the seven who were upgraded and six of the seven who were downgraded. (The one Democrat was Representative Sanford D. Bishop Jr. of Georgia, who went from a C to an F; as recently as 2018, he had received an A and an N.R.A. endorsement.) The downgraded Republicans ? Senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Marco Rubio of Florida and Todd Young of Indiana, and Representatives Steve Chabot of Ohio, Tony Gonzales of Texas and David Joyce of Ohio ? all went from A¡¯s to B¡¯s. Mr. Rubio¡¯s new grade reflected his decision to endorse limited gun restrictions after the Parkland, Fla., shooting in 2018. (Since senators receive ratings only when they run for re-election, this is the first year in which he has been graded since 2016.) The other Republicans who were downgraded voted for the bipartisan gun bill that passed in June. It was the first time in nearly three decades that Congress ? long held in check by N.R.A. lobbying ? passed any significant restriction on guns.

Next week, the Supreme Court is set to consider whether to hear an appeal of that decision, which applied a history-based test to rule that the government was powerless to disarm Mr. Rahimi under the domestic-violence law. The chances that the justices will agree to hear the case are good. The case started in 2019, when Mr. Rahimi assaulted his girlfriend and threatened to shoot her if she told anyone, leading her to obtain a restraining order. The order suspended Mr. Rahimi¡¯s handgun license and prohibited him from possessing firearms. Mr. Rahimi defied the order in flagrant fashion, according to court records. He threatened a different woman with a gun, leading to charges of assault with a deadly weapon. Then, in the space of two months, he opened fire in public five times. Upset about a social media post from someone to whom he had sold drugs, for instance, he shot an AR-15 rifle into his former client¡¯s home. When a fast-food restaurant declined a friend¡¯s credit card, he fired several bullets into the air. The shootings led to a search warrant of Mr. Rahimi¡¯s home, which uncovered weapons, and he was charged with violating the federal law. After a judge rejected his Second Amendment challenge to the law, he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to more than six years in prison. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit at first affirmed his conviction in a short decision, rejecting the argument that the law violated the Second Amendment in a footnote. But the appeals reversed course after the Supreme Court issued a decision last June establishing a new test to decide whether gun control laws are constitutional, one focused on history. Under that test, a unanimous three-judge panel of the Fifth Circuit ruled, the law prohibiting people subject to domestic-violence orders from possessing firearms violated the Second Amendment because there was no historical support for it. Next week, almost a year to the day after the Supreme Court announced the new approach in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen, the justices are set to meet to discuss whether to hear the Biden administration¡¯s appeal. The court often hears appeals of decisions holding federal laws unconstitutional. The case, United States v. Rahimi, No. 22-915, would give the court a chance to explore the scope of its new test, which requires the government to identify historical analogues to justify laws limiting Second Amendment rights. As a general matter, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in his majority opinion in Bruen, the Second Amendment protects the rights of ¡°an ordinary, law-abiding citizen.¡± And there is, the Biden administration told the justices in the new case, ¡°strong historical evidence supporting the general principle that the government may disarm dangerous individuals.¡± But the Fifth Circuit rejected a variety of old laws identified by the government as possible analogues, saying they did not sufficiently resemble the one concerning domestic-violence orders. Many of them, Judge Cory T. Wilson wrote for the panel, ¡°disarmed classes of people considered to be dangerous, specifically including those unwilling to take an oath of allegiance, slaves and Native Americans.¡± That was different, he wrote, from domestic-violence orders, which make case-by-case judgments about a particular individual¡¯s dangerousness. Lawyers for the administration questioned that distinction. ¡°It would be bizarre,¡± they wrote, ¡°if legislatures could disarm dangerous individuals based on categorical presumptions, but not based on individualized judicial findings after notice and a hearing.¡± Judge Wilson, who was appointed by President Donald J. Trump, wrote that the government¡¯s insistence that it can disarm people who are not law-abiding ¡°admits to no true limiting principle.¡± ¡°Could speeders be stripped of their right to keep and bear arms?¡± he asked. ¡°Political nonconformists? People who do not recycle or drive an electric vehicle?¡± Judge Wilson conceded that the challenged law ¡°embodies salutary policy goals meant to protect vulnerable people in our society.¡± But he said the approach required by the Bruen decision did not allow courts to weigh the benefits of the law against its burdens. What was important, he wrote, quoting that decision, was that ¡°our ancestors would never have accepted¡± the law on domestic-violence orders. Judge James C. Ho, who was also appointed by Mr. Trump, issued a concurring opinion saying there were better ways to protect victims of domestic abuse. ¡°Those who commit violence, including domestic violence,¡± he wrote, ¡°shouldn¡¯t just be disarmed ? they should be detained, prosecuted, convicted and incarcerated. And that¡¯s exactly why we have a criminal justice system ? to punish criminals and disable them from engaging in further crimes.¡± But Judge Ho said domestic-violence orders were products of the civil justice system and were subject to abuse. ¡°Scholars and judges have expressed alarm that civil protective orders are too often misused as a tactical device in divorce proceedings ? and issued without any actual threat of danger,¡± he wrote. ¡°That makes it difficult to justify¡± the law Mr. Rahimi challenged ¡°as a measure to disarm dangerous individuals.¡± In a brief urging the Supreme Court to deny review, lawyers for Mr. Rahimi said domestic violence was not a new phenomenon. ¡°The founders could have adopted a complete ban on firearms to combat intimate-partner violence,¡± their brief said. ¡°They didn¡¯t.¡± Adam Liptak covers the Supreme Court and writes Sidebar, a column on legal developments.

He also dodged questions on abortion, praised Jan. 6 rioters and mocked E. Jean Carroll.  Jonathan Weisman Former President Donald J. Trump used a raucous town hall meeting in New Hampshire ? broadcast live on CNN ? to resume the lies and name-calling that marked his presidency, signaling to voters that criminal investigations, a jury holding him liable for sexual abuse and ongoing struggles with swing voters have not changed him a bit. He pressed his false claim that the 2020 election was stolen from him, praised the rioters who violently attacked the Capitol and suggested that Congress allow the federal government to default on its debt, at the risk of a global economic crisis. A day after a Manhattan jury ordered him to pay $5 million in damages to E. Jean Carroll, who accused him of sexually abusing and defaming her, he called her a ¡°wack job,¡± and then called CNN¡¯s moderator, Kaitlan Collins, ¡°a nasty person.¡± CNN had been criticized by some Democrats for giving Mr. Trump, the front-runner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, such a platform. And from the outset, the former president showed how difficult a live television interview can be, though his bluster did not seem calibrated to appeal to swing voters. Mr. Trump had not appeared on a major television channel outside the conservative media bubble since 2020, and his prevarications, half truths, lies and name-calling on Wednesday showed he had not changed his politics ahead of his run for another presidential term. Even after a New Hampshire Republican voter asked if he would drop his polarizing talk, he hedged, saying he would drop it if there is no election fraud. He then showed he was unrepentant about the deadly attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, praising the rioters. ¡°They were proud. They were there with love in their heart,¡± he said, adding, ¡°That was a beautiful day.¡± Among the subjects Mr. Trump addressed: A day after a jury found Mr. Trump liable for sexual abuse and defamation, he viciously mocked his accuser, E. Jean Carroll. The audience laughed along. ¡°I have no idea who this woman is,¡± he said. ¡°This is a fake story.¡± He then called Ms. Carroll ¡°a wack job.¡± He lied continuously about the 2020 election, raising allegations on election fraud that have been repeatedly debunked. And he showed no contrition for behavior around the 2020 election that has sparked criminal investigations in Washington and the state of Georgia. He counseled Congress to allow the federal government to default on its debt in June if President Biden did not come the Republicans¡¯ way on deep spending cuts. A default could precipitate a global economic crisis. Mr. Trump shrugged: ¡°Might as well do it now because we¡¯re going to do it later,¡± he said. In one of the few overtures to swing voters, Mr. Trump repeatedly dodged questions on whether he would sign a nationwide abortion ban or say at what stage of pregnancy abortion should be illegal. ¡°What I will do is negotiate so that people are happy,¡± he said. Mr. Trump hedged on the future of American military aid to Ukraine, saying Europe needed to spend more and that his emphasis would be ending the war, not ensuring Ukraine¡¯s victory. He also insisted that he now has no more classified documents at his Palm Beach, Fla., home at Mar-a-Lago, an answer that could impact the ongoing federal investigation of his handling of highly classified records after his presidency. Mr. Trump also proudly defended his administration¡¯s policy of separating young children from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border. When the policy was first exposed, he had denied it was happening. On Wednesday, he said such cruelty was necessary to deter families from illegally crossing the frontier.  Shane Goldmacher and Maggie Haberman Donald?Trump is still Donald Trump. His 70 minutes onstage in New Hampshire served as a vivid reminder that the former president has only one speed, and that his second act mirrors his first. He is, as ever, a celebrity performance artist and, even out of office, remains the center of gravity in American politics. CNN¡¯s decision to give him an unfiltered prime-time platform was a callback to the 2016 campaign, even as the moderator, Kaitlan Collins, persistently interjected to try to cut him off or correct him. Mr. Trump was so focused on discussing and defending himself that he barely touched on President Biden¡¯s record ? which people close to Mr. Trump want him to focus on. But he was disciplined when it came to his chief expected primary rival. Here are five takeaways. If viewers were expecting Mr. Trump to have moved on from his falsehood that the 2020 election was stolen from him, he demonstrated once again, right out of the gate, that he very much hasn¡¯t. The first questions asked by Ms. Collins were about Mr. Trump¡¯s refusal to accept his loss in 2020, and his false claims of fraud. ¡°I think that, when you look at that result and when you look at what happened during that election, unless you¡¯re a very stupid person, you see what happens,¡± Mr. Trump said, calling the election he lost ¡°rigged.¡± Mr. Trump later said he was ¡°inclined¡± to pardon ¡°many¡± of the rioters arrested on Jan. 6, 2021, after the attack on the Capitol by a pro-Trump mob during certification of President Biden¡¯s Electoral College win. His?avoidance?of an unequivocal promise pleased people close to him. He also came armed with a list of his own Twitter posts and statements from that day ? an idea that was his, a person familiar with the planning said. He lied about his inaction that day as Ms. Collins pressed him about what he was doing during the hours of violence. And he said he did not owe Vice President Mike Pence, whose life was threatened by the mob, an apology. As time has worn on, Mr. Trump has increasingly wrapped his arms around what took place at the Capitol and incorporated it into his campaign. Wednesday night was no exception. ¡°A beautiful day,¡± he said of Jan. 6. It was a reminder that embracing the deadly violence of that day ? at least for Republicans ? is no longer seen as disqualifying. Privately, Mr. Trump¡¯s team said they were happy with how he handled the extensive time spent on the postelection period during the town hall. The audience¡¯s regular interruptions on behalf of Mr. Trump were like a laugh track on a sitcom. It built momentum for him in the room ? and onscreen for the television audience ? and stifled Ms. Collins as she repeatedly tried to interrupt him with facts and correctives. No matter how vulgar, profane or politically incorrect Mr. Trump was, the Republican crowd in New Hampshire audibly ate up the shtick of the decades-long showman. He would pardon a ¡°large portion¡± of Jan. 6 rioters. Applause. He mocked the detailed accusations of rape from E. Jean Carroll as made up ¡°hanky-panky in a dressing room.¡± Laughter. No matter that a New York jury held him liable for sexual abuse and defamation this week, awarding Ms. Carroll $5 million in damages. Calling Ms. Carroll a ¡°wack job.¡± Applause and laughs. Flip-flopping on using the debt ceiling for leverage, because ¡°I¡¯m not president.¡± More laughs. The cheers revealed the current psyche of the Republican base, which is eager for confrontation: with the press, with Democrats, with anyone standing in the way of Republicans taking power. It made for tough sledding for Ms. Collins, who was like an athlete playing an away game on hostile turf: She had to battle the crowd and the candidate simultaneously. ¡°You¡¯re a nasty person,¡± Mr. Trump said to her at one point, echoing the line he used against Hillary Clinton in 2016. The town-hall format felt like a set piece for Mr. Trump that he leveraged to cast himself as both the putative Republican incumbent ? ¡°Mister president,¡± he was repeatedly addressed as ? and the outsider, recreating conditions from his two previous campaigns. President Biden¡¯s team had changed the televisions on Air Force One from CNN to MSNBC as he returned from New York on Wednesday evening. But that didn¡¯t mean his political team was not eagerly watching the town hall unfold, and cheering along with the Republican audience. Mr. Trump defended Jan. 6 as a ¡°beautiful day.¡± He hailed the overturning of Roe v. Wade as a ¡°great victory.¡± He wouldn¡¯t say if he hoped Ukraine would win the war against Russia. He talked again about how the rich and famous get their way. ¡°Women let you,¡± he said. And he refused to rule out reimposing one of the most incendiary and divisive policies of his term in office: purposefully separating families at the border. Mr. Trump¡¯s answers played well in the hall but could all find their way into Democratic messaging in the next 18 months. Late Wednesday, the Biden campaign was already figuring out what segments could be turned quickly into digital ads, seeing Mr. Trump staking out positions that would turn off the kind of swing voters that Mr. Biden won in 2020. Shortly after the event ended, Mr. Biden issued a tweet. ¡°Do you want four more years of that?¡± it read. It was a request for donations. It was also a reminder how much of the Biden 2024 campaign is likely to be about Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump is perhaps the single Republican most responsible for the Supreme Court¡¯s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade last year. He appointed three of the court¡¯s justices who powered the majority opinion. But he has privately blamed abortion politics for Republican underperformance in the 2022 midterms and has?treaded carefully in the early months of his 2024 run. Before the town hall, his team spent considerable time honing his answer to a question they knew he would be asked: Would he support a federal ban, and at how many weeks? His repeated dodges and euphemisms were hard to miss on Wednesday. ¡°Getting rid of Roe v. Wade was an incredible thing for pro-life,¡± he began. That was about as specific as he would get. He said he was ¡°honored to have done what I?did¡± ? a line Democrats had quickly flagged as potential fodder for future ads ? and that it was a ¡°great victory.¡± Mr. Trump¡¯s Republican rival,?Gov. Ron DeSantis, recently signed a six-week abortion ban in Florida, getting to Mr. Trump¡¯s right on an issue that could resonate with evangelical voters. Mr. Trump did not even mention Mr. DeSantis until more than an hour into the event, and only after prodding from a voter. ¡°I think he ought to relax and take it easy and think about the future,¡± Mr. Trump urged. In refusing to say if he would sign a federal ban, Mr. Trump tried to cast Democrats as radical and pledged that he supported exemptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother. ¡°What I¡¯ll do is negotiate so people are happy,¡± he said. ¡°I just want to give you one more chance,¡± Ms. Collins pressed. He dodged one final time. ¡°Make a deal that¡¯s going to be good,¡± he said. The most heated exchange that Mr. Trump had with Ms. Collins was over the special counsel investigation into his possession of hundreds of presidential records, including more than 300 individual classified documents, at his private club, Mar-a-Lago, after he left office. And it was the area in which he walked himself into the biggest problems. ¡°I was there and I took what I took and it gets declassified,¡± said Mr. Trump, who has maintained, despite contradictions from his own former officials, that he had a standing order automatically declassifying documents that left the Oval Office and went to the president¡¯s residence. ¡°I had every right to do it, I didn¡¯t make a secret of it. You know, the boxes were stationed outside the White House, people were taking pictures of it,¡± Mr. Trump said, intimating that people were somehow aware that presidential material and classified documents were in them (they were not). In what will be of great interest to the special counsel, Jack Smith, Mr. Trump would not definitively rule out whether he showed classified material to people, something investigators have queried witnesses about, in particular in connection with a map with sensitive intelligence. ¡°Not really,¡± he hedged, adding, ¡°I would have the right to.¡± At another point he declared, ¡°I have the right to do whatever I want with them.¡± He also defended himself for a call he had with Georgia¡¯s secretary of state in which he said he was trying to ¡°find¡± enough votes to win. ¡°I didn¡¯t ask him to find anything,¡± Mr. Trump said. There are few issues that worry the Trump team and the former president as much as the documents investigation, and Mr. Trump wore that on his face and in his words on the stage in New Hampshire.  Reid Epstein Shortly after the town hall ended, President Biden weighed in on Twitter with something of a campaign tag line: ¡°It¡¯s simple, folks. Do you want four more years of that?¡±  Reid Epstein On Air Force One, the assembled press requested that the TVs be switched to CNN for the town hall. The channel was changed. During the flight from New York, Biden¡¯s senior adviser, Anita Dunn, entered the press cabin, looked at the televisions and left, according to a pool report.  Linda Qiu ? Former President Donald J. Trump Mr. Trump has repeatedly and wrongly compared his handling of classified documents with that of his predecessor.  Maggie Haberman The Trump campaign is out with a statement saying that Trump ¡°laid out his vision to reverse the Biden Decline.¡± Yet he spent relatively little time on Biden.  Michael Grynbaum CNN has cut away to analysis from its anchors Anderson Cooper and Jake Tapper, who tells viewers, ¡°The falsehoods kept coming fast and furious.¡±  Reid Epstein It remains to be seen how this sort of Trump performance will play in the Republican primary, but it¡¯s not likely to be helpful in the general election. Allies of his who echoed false claims about the 2020 election lost competitive 2022 elections in battleground states. This denial and relitigating of his defeat to President Biden is kryptonite to voters in the political middle who determine elections in key states.  Jonathan Swan The crowd is raucous, like a rally crowd cheering Trump.  Maggie Haberman Trump shook Collins¡¯s hand and said, ¡°Good job.¡± That¡¯s it.  Maggie Haberman And now it¡¯s abruptly over.  Shane Goldmacher More than an hour into this town hall, Trump first mentions his leading Republican rival in the polls, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, and it comes only after a voter brings DeSantis up.  Maggie Haberman Trump won¡¯t commit to accepting the results of the 2024 election if he¡¯s the nominee.  Jonathan Weisman Trump¡¯s frustration with Kaitlan Collins¡¯s corrections and questioning appears to have him flustered.  Maggie Haberman Trump is now bellowing at Collins on a topic he¡¯s facing a potential indictment over: his call to Georgia¡¯s top election official pressuring him to ""find"" votes.  Maggie Haberman That¡¯s contrary to what he has claimed before, which is that they were declassified while he was president.  Maggie Haberman This is bad territory for Trump. ¡°I don¡¯t have anything,¡± Trump says, claiming the documents were ¡°automatically declassified¡± when he took them.  Michael Grynbaum Trump¡¯s growing irritation with Collins boiled over in that tough moment, when he called her a ¡°nasty person.¡± The audience offered no support for the CNN anchor, applauding Trump¡¯s insult. Collins did not react.  Jonathan Swan This section ? Collins¡¯s questioning over the classified documents ? is potentially a legally dangerous moment for Trump. Especially his ambiguous comment about whether he showed classified documents to other people.  Linda Qiu ? Former President Donald J. Trump Under guidelines for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, members agreed to commit a minimum of 2 percent of G.D.P. on their own defense, but few nations actually do so. They do not ¡°pay¡± the alliance directly.  Maggie Haberman Trump¡¯s statement that he took the documents is contrary to a letter one of his lawyers sent to Congress recently, claiming the documents had been accidentally sent to Mar-a-Lago.  Maggie Haberman Trump uses the same line on Collins he used on Hillary Clinton. ¡°You¡¯re a nasty person,¡± he tells her, to applause from the crowd.  Maggie Haberman ¡°Not really,¡± Trump says when asked if he showed people classified material after leaving office, as prosecutors believe he may have done.  Reid Epstein An hour into this event, Trump finally takes a shot at President Biden, accusing him of improperly taking classified documents. (Biden¡¯s lawyers reported the documents themselves, unlike Trump, whose home was raided by the F.B.I. to retrieve the documents.)  Maggie Haberman ¡°I took the documents, I¡¯m allowed to,¡± Trump says.  Maggie Haberman They are discussing the investigation into Trump¡¯s possession of presidential documents at Mar-a-Lago.  Michael Grynbaum Trump and Collins are now standing up.  Linda Qiu ? Former President Donald J. Trump The Trump administration constructed 453 miles of border wall over four years, and a vast majority of the new barriers reinforced or replaced existing structures. Of that, about 47 miles were new primary barriers. The United States¡¯ southwestern border with Mexico is over 1,900 miles, and during his campaign, Mr. Trump had vowed to build a wall across the entire border and make Mexico pay for it. Mexico did not pay for the barriers that had been constructed.  Maggie Haberman Collins asks if Vladimir Putin is a war criminal. Trump says that should be discussed ¡°later,¡± in the hopes of forging a deal to end the war.  Linda Qiu ? Former President Donald J. Trump A Manhattan jury on Tuesday found that Mr. Trump had sexually abused and defamed E. Jean Carroll, a writer. Regardless of whether Mr. Trump remembers meeting Ms. Carroll, there is clear evidence that the two have met: a black-and-white photo of the two along with their spouses at the time.   Jonathan Swan Trump is now saying that Putin made a ¡°tremendous mistake¡± by invading Ukraine. That is different from his initial commentary on the invasion, which he described as an act of genius.  Reid Epstein Trump has not spent much time attacking President Biden tonight, even though he¡¯s had plenty of chances to do so. He was served up a chance to criticize Biden on support for the war in Ukraine, and he instead repeated his assertion that European countries should invest more in the conflict.  Jonathan Swan This Ukraine exchange with Collins is the most heated Trump has been during the debate.  Maggie Haberman ¡°I want them to stop dying,¡± Trump says, pressed repeatedly on whether he wants Ukraine to win the war.  Maggie Haberman Collins¡¯s question ? does Trump want Ukraine to win the war? ? is different from how the question has been asked before.  Jonathan Swan Trump refuses to say that he wants Ukraine to win the war.  Maggie Haberman Trump repeatedly dodges whether he would continue giving aid to Ukraine against Russia.  Maggie Haberman Asked whether he would institute family separation for migrants at the border again, Trump refuses to answer, saying that when there¡¯s such a policy, ¡°They don¡¯t come.¡±  Maggie Haberman Trump again falsely says the election was rigged. Collins protests and says, ¡°You can¡¯t keep saying that all night long.¡±  Jonathan Swan Advisers to Trump are thrilled at how this is going so far for him. They can¡¯t believe he is getting an hour on CNN with an audience that cheers his every line and laughs at his every joke.  Reid Epstein Trump has to hope that the rest of this event focuses on issues more to his liking, such as immigration, inflation, the economy and President Biden¡¯s handling of the withdrawal from Afghanistan. It will also be interesting to see how much Trump is pressed on Russia¡¯s invasion of Ukraine.  Linda Qiu ? Former President Donald J. Trump Opponents of firearm restrictions frequently cite Chicago as a case study of how tough gun laws do little to prevent homicides. This argument, however, relies on faulty assumptions about the city¡¯s gun laws and gun violence. There were more gun murders in Chicago than in any other city in the United States in 2020, fueling the perception that it is the gun violence capital of the country. But Chicago is also the third-largest city in the country. Adjusted by population, the gun homicide rate was 25.2 per 100,000, the 26th highest in the country in 2020, according to data compiled by the gun-control group Everytown for Gun Safety. The three cities with the highest gun homicide rates ? Jackson, Miss., Gary, Ind., and St. Louis ? had rates double that of Chicago¡¯s. All are in states with more permissive gun laws than Illinois. Chicago¡¯s reputation for having the strictest gun control measures in the country is outdated. The Supreme Court nullified the city¡¯s handgun ban in 2010. An appeals court also struck down a ban on carrying concealed weapons in Illinois in 2012, and the state began allowing possession of concealed guns in 2013, as part of the court decision. Today, Illinois has tougher restrictions than most states, but it does not lead the pack, ranking No. 7 in Everytown¡¯s assessment of the strength of state gun control laws, and No. 8 in a report card released by the Giffords Law Center, another gun control group. Conversely, the state ranked No. 41 in an assessment on gun rights from the libertarian Cato Institute. Gun control proponents have also argued that the patchwork nature of gun laws in the country makes it difficult for a state like Illinois with tough restrictions on the books to enforce those in practice. A 2017 study commissioned by the city of Chicago found, for example, that 60 percent of guns used in crimes and recovered in Chicago came from out of state, with neighboring Indiana as the primary source.  Linda Qiu ? Former President Donald J. Trump Average growth, even before the coronavirus pandemic decimated the economy, was lower under Mr. Trump than under Presidents Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan.  Maggie Haberman Trump¡¯s avoidance of taking a position on a federal abortion ban may not hurt him in a Republican primary, but his comment essentially telling Collins he¡¯ll decide what¡¯s best when he¡¯s in office is going to be an added motivator for voters who are livid at the end of Roe v. Wade.  Michael Grynbaum Kaitlan Collins, in one of the biggest moments of her TV career, has calmly corrected many of Trump¡¯s false statements and prompted him to clarify his policy positions. So far, she has avoided being lured into a major confrontation.  Jonathan Weisman ¡°What I will do is negotiate so that people are happy,¡± he says as he dodges the question about signing a federal abortion ban.  Linda Qiu ? Former President Donald J. Trump The vice president does not have the power or legal authority to alter the presidential election, as former Vice President Mike Pence has repeatedly and correctly noted. A select House committee investigating the events of Jan. 6, 2021 found that John Eastman, a conservative lawyer who was the chief architect of Mr. Trump¡¯s attempts to overturn the 2020 election, had admitted to Mr. Trump two days before Jan. 6 that his plan to have Mr. Pence to halt the vote certification process was illegal.  Linda Qiu ? Former President Donald J. Trump Mr. Trump was referring to the events of Jan. 6, 2021, when his loyalists stormed the Capitol in a bid to stop the certification of Joseph R. Biden Jr.¡¯s election victory. There is no evidence that Mr. Trump ever made a request for 10,000 National Guard troops or that Speaker Nancy Pelosi rejected such a demand. The speaker of the House does not control the National Guard.  Linda Qiu ? Former President Donald J. Trump Mr. Trump received 74 million votes in the 2020 presidential election, 12 million more than he received in the 2016 election. But, of course, President Biden received even more votes in 2020: 81 million. Mr. Trump then repeated his lie that the 2020 election was rigged. As the CNN moderator Kaitlan Collins noted, no evidence has surfaced to support his false claims of an army of people voting multiple times, dead people voting and missing ballots.  Jonathan Weisman A super PAC supporting Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida took a swing at both Donald J. Trump and CNN ahead of Wednesday night¡¯s town hall, painting them as failing partners seeking the favor of the Washington elite. ¡°The Trump town hall on CNN is a true marriage of equals: a candidate who has lost his luster appearing on a network that¡¯s lost its ratings,¡± Chris Jankowski, the chief executive of Never Back Down, wrote in a statement. ¡°Both ignore a key fact: 2024 isn¡¯t 2016. The old gimmicks and tired lines don¡¯t work anymore.¡± Ahead of what is expected to be an official entry into the 2024 Republican race for the presidential nomination, Mr. DeSantis has been struggling with sagging poll numbers and a dearth of attention as Mr. Trump once again swallows the media¡¯s focus. CNN¡¯s decision to give Mr. Trump his own prime-time town hall exemplified Mr. DeSantis¡¯s problem, but the governor¡¯s well-funded super PAC, ostensibly independent of the candidate, tried to turn Mr. Trump¡¯s appearance into a boost for its candidate. Mr. Jankowski¡¯s lengthy statement was careful not to alienate Mr. Trump¡¯s core of support. It did not mention the jury verdict on Tuesday, which found the former president liable for sexual assault, nor did it challenge Mr. Trump on policy. It did try to frame Mr. DeSantis as the former president¡¯s heir apparent. ¡°It¡¯s stunning to see Donald Trump transform into a made-for-CNN candidate, desperately seeking a national town hall, the most elite of elite forums,¡± the statement said. ¡°After all, in 2016, it was Donald Trump who electroshocked the Republican Party out of its elitism.¡±  Jonathan Weisman Donald J. Trump¡¯s decision to appear Wednesday night on a CNN town hall meeting long preceded the jury verdict on Tuesday that found him liable for sexual abuse and defamation ? but that verdict is likely to loom large as the former president takes his case for a second term to a broader cable news audience. The Manhattan jury decided that the writer E. Jean Carroll had not proved that Mr. Trump raped her in a dressing room of the Bergdorf Goodman department store, but she had sufficiently proved that he had sexually assaulted her in the 1990s, then defamed her after she came forward with her story. Jurors awarded Ms. Carroll $5 million in damages. Mr. Trump has long maintained his innocence, and after the jury¡¯s defamation decision, he kept on attacking Ms. Carroll, who he said ¡°made a false and totally fabricated accusation.¡± He promised to appeal. At the core of the former president¡¯s defense are two positions: that the jury found him not liable for rape, yet somehow liable for defaming the woman who accused him of rape; and that Democratic state lawmakers in New York passed a new law specifically to allow Ms. Carroll, a critic of Mr. Trump, to sue him. The first defense ignores the fact that jurors were considering three types of battery for which Mr. Trump might be liable under New York law: rape, sexual abuse and forcible touching. Jurors did not conclude that Mr. Trump had engaged in forcible sexual intercourse, but they did believe he subjected Ms. Carroll to sexual contact by physical force. His repeated statements that she made up the entire altercation were enough to land him a defamation judgment, rape or not. And while it is true that Ms. Carroll filed her civil suit under the Adult Survivors Act, which Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York signed last year, Mr. Trump was not the target of that law, which offered a one-time opportunity for abuse victims to file civil lawsuits in New York, even if any statutes of limitations have run out. Those who pushed the state legislation included Ms. Carroll but also Drew Dixon, who said she had long suppressed her claim that the media mogul Russell Simmons had raped her; Evelyn Yang, wife of the former presidential candidate Andrew Yang, who said she was abused by a former Columbia University gynecologist, Robert Hadden; and former female inmates at state prisons who hoped to sue the New York Department of Corrections for abuses under its watch.  Maggie Haberman and Jonathan Swan Follow for live updates on the Trump CNN town hall meeting. No questions will be off-limits on Wednesday night at the CNN town hall with Donald J. Trump. He can put 15 people of his choice in the audience but none are allowed to ask questions. And his team has not had a hand in guiding how the event will go, according to two people briefed on the discussions. All of this adds up to no small amount of risk for the former president during the prime-time event, his advisers say ? a risk they see as worth taking. They expect tough questions from the CNN anchor and moderator, Kaitlan Collins ? and have been anticipating questions about abortion, investigations into Mr. Trump and a civil jury¡¯s finding him liable for defamation and sexual abuse in the lawsuit brought by E. Jean Carroll?in Manhattan, a verdict handed down a day before the town hall. But they also know he will mostly be facing questions from an audience of Republicans and Republican-leaning independent voters in New Hampshire, the state hosting the first primary of the 2024 Republican presidential contest. It was the first state Mr. Trump won in 2016 and a place where he still enjoys popularity among Republicans. Since the end of his presidency, Mr. Trump has largely been relegated to appearing on right-wing networks and podcasts. He has taken reporters aboard his plane now that he¡¯s a candidate, but his team recognizes that he needs to start venturing beyond the fringe to gain access to a broader audience, particularly as a contrast to Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, who avoids the mainstream media. And CNN was willing to provide him that opportunity, several advisers said. The town hall will be Mr. Trump¡¯s first appearance on CNN since the 2016 campaign. ¡°You can¡¯t just stay on certain channels all the time,¡± said a person close to Mr. Trump who was not authorized to speak publicly about the town hall planning. ¡°You¡¯ve got to start venturing out. And that¡¯s a clear contrast to what other candidates may or may not do.¡± The town hall has been months in the making. Earlier this year, Mr. Trump¡¯s team had wanted to participate in a Fox News town hall with Sean Hannity, a popular pro-Trump anchor. But Mr. Hannity ultimately did an interview with Mr. Trump instead, and the town hall never materialized. Through a Fox News press officer, Mr. Hannity denied there was any obstacle to a Fox town hall, insisting Mr. Trump ¡°preferred to do an interview on this occasion and said he would do a town hall as his campaign progressed.¡± Several weeks after Mr. Trump declared his candidacy in November, CNN was in touch with the former president¡¯s team about a possible interview, as the network has held with other presidential candidates, said two people familiar with the discussions who requested anonymity to describe the talks. As the conversations about a Fox News town hall fizzled, the Trump team began negotiating with CNN in earnest. ¡°There is no change to our format because of the unique nature of Donald Trump¡¯s candidacy,¡± said David Chalian, CNN¡¯s political director. ¡°CNN¡¯s role of bringing a candidate into direct touch with voters in this town hall format has been and continues to be a staple of our presidential campaign coverage.¡± Mr. Trump is not prone to practice sessions. His debate preparations during his two previous presidential campaigns often devolved into him telling old war stories or yelling at aides. For this occasion, Mr. Trump held an informal session with a handful of aides, including his speechwriter, Vince Haley, on Monday in his office at Mar-a-Lago, according to multiple people briefed on the gathering. No one was assigned to play Ms. Collins. Aides have instead discussed questions that might arise. The Trump team has spent considerable time discussing the politics of abortion. Mr. Trump is more responsible than anyone ? with the possible exception of the Republican Senate leader, Mitch McConnell ? for the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade. Yet Mr. Trump himself has at times been privately ambivalent about the consequences of the decision, and has blamed abortion politics for Republicans¡¯ dismal performance in the 2022 midterm elections. He discussed the subject as if he were a pundit or bystander rather than the architect of Roe v. Wade¡¯s demise. And he has troubled some prominent anti-abortion activists in the way he has handled questions about abortion policy since the midterms. Mr. Trump has refused to sa",NYT

By Michael Gold Gloria Johnson, a Democratic state representative from Tennessee who narrowly avoided being expelled from the Legislature in April after taking part in a gun control protest on the statehouse floor, announced plans on Tuesday to run for the U.S. Senate seat held by Senator Marsha Blackburn, a Republican. Ms. Johnson, 61, received a flood of national attention after she joined two other Democrats, Representatives Justin Jones and Justin J. Pearson, to interrupt debate on the floor of the Republican-controlled Tennessee House of Representatives and rally for stricter gun control measures in late March, just days after a shooting at a Christian school in Nashville that killed six people. In retribution, Republicans moved to expel the three Democrats ? sometimes called the Tennessee Three ? from the Legislature. Mr. Jones and Mr. Pearson were both ousted. Ms. Johnson was stripped of her committee assignments but avoided expulsion by just one vote. (Both men were later voted back into their positions.) Last week, the State Legislature held an emotional and chaotic special session meant to be devoted to public safety that ended without agreement on any significant new restrictions on firearm access. In a video announcing her Senate campaign, Ms. Johnson led with that issue, playing clips of news coverage of the Nashville shooting and highlighting her involvement in the gun control protest. ¡°When my friends and I believed mothers and fathers who lost children at Covenant deserved a voice, and we fought for it, they expelled them,¡± she says in the video. Ms. Johnson, who represents parts of Knoxville, was first elected to the Tennessee House in 2012, then lost subsequent elections in 2014 and 2016 before again winning in 2018. For the 2024 Senate race, she is running in a contested Democratic primary against Marquita Bradshaw, an environmental justice activist who unsuccessfully ran for U.S. Senate in 2020. Both hope to unseat Ms. Blackburn, 71, who in 2018 became the first woman elected to represent Tennessee in the Senate. In her video, Ms. Johnson suggested that Ms. Blackburn was beholden to ¡°extremists and billionaires,¡± criticizing her views on abortion. Senator Blackburn¡¯s campaign spokeswoman, Abigail Sigler, accused Ms. Johnson in a statement of being a ¡°radical socialist¡± who ¡°would be a puppet¡± for President Biden and progressive Democrats.

But in a nation trained to ¡°Run, Hide, Fight,¡± many say it should never have come to that. A memorial outside Star Ballroom Dance Studio in Monterey Park, Calif., where a gunman killed 11 people.

Jason Seaman, a seventh-grade science teacher in Noblesville, Ind., was helping a student with a test when a classmate returned from the bathroom, drew a handgun from his pocket and began firing. Mr. Seaman, now 34, threw a mini basketball at the student and then charged, swiftly disarming him. ¡°There was no choice ? it was either do something, or die,¡± he said in an interview on Tuesday, recalling the shooting in May 2018 that left him with gunshot wounds in the abdomen, a forearm and a hand. ¡°So when you¡¯re in that literal life-or-death situation, I¡¯m dang sure I¡¯m going to fight.¡± ¡°Run, Hide, Fight¡± became the federal guidance on how to react to an active shooting after the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, with Americans encouraged to consider confronting a gunman if they cannot safely flee or stay out of sight. In the years since, it has been drilled into Americans¡¯ heads in schools, in workplaces and in private training sessions, a bleak mantra for a nation with hundreds of millions of guns and where mass shootings have become an ever-escalating plague. Advocates for stronger gun laws contend that no American should have to put their body on the line in the face of a gunman armed with military-style weapons at a dance hall, a religious service, a mall, a high school. But in high-profile massacres in recent months, the last resort to fight has been taken up by bystanders, who have attacked gunmen and stopped them before they could continue. In Colorado Springs in November, two bystanders, including an Army veteran, physically subdued an assailant who had entered a nightclub and killed five people in a matter of seconds. In suburban Indianapolis last summer, an armed bystander fatally shot a gunman who had already killed three people in a mall food court. And in Los Angeles County last weekend, the authorities said, an employee of a dance hall wrestled an assault pistol out of the hands of a gunman who had already shot 20 people at another venue and seemed bent on more mayhem. ¡°This could have been much worse,¡± said Sheriff Robert Luna of Los Angeles County. Experts say that bystander intervention in active shootings ends the threat in a significant minority of cases, and the forces that drive people to intervene are varied. But in many situations, bystanders are unable to run or hide, trapped in classrooms or churches with attackers who are armed with high-powered weapons. Gun massacres at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., the Pulse nightclub in Orlando and Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, are all examples of shootings where police officers or school security personnel were criticized as being slow to help civilians once a shooting was underway. Some Americans confronted by an armed assailant in more recent incidents have understood instantly: They are on their own. ¡°I feel like people are starting to come to the realization that the only one who¡¯s going to protect you is you,¡± said Jack Wilson, a county commissioner in Hood County, Texas, who teaches concealed-carry classes. ¡°People have to be willing to intervene to stop these kinds of issues.¡± He was one of those bystanders: In 2019, Mr. Wilson was attending Sunday services at his church in White Settlement, Texas, when a gunman opened fire, killing two people. Mr. Wilson pulled out his own gun and fired, killing the assailant with a single shot. ¡°The only way law enforcement is going assist you is if they¡¯re in your driveway,¡± he said. ¡°That¡¯s not a slam against law enforcement. They can¡¯t be everywhere.¡± Deputizing the public as a tool of last resort has not caused the pace of mass shootings to slow down. Already this year, at least 69 people have died in at least 39 separate shootings in which four or more people were injured or killed, according to the Gun Violence Archive. ¡°If anyone¡¯s saying, ¡®I¡¯m hearing more about active shooters being tackled or stopped by civilians,¡¯ it may be true that is occurring more often,¡± said Adam Lankford, a professor of criminology at the University of Alabama. ¡°But it could be a function of there being more total attacks.¡± Sometimes, bystander interventions have been met with tragic consequences. In 2019, Riley Howell, a student at University of North Carolina at Charlotte, was shot while trying to stop a gunman, though he managed to charge the assailant and pin him down. Mr. Howell, a 21-year-old former high school soccer goalie, died in the attack. Advocates for stricter gun laws said that outsize attention on bystander interventions in mass shootings could distract from the deeper issue of the country¡¯s unrelenting cycle of gun violence. ¡°Instead of focusing on why these tragedies keep happening, we focus on the heroic acts of the bystander,¡± said Shannon Watts, the founder of the gun-control organization Moms Demand Action. ¡°We should always call a hero a hero and thank them for selflessly putting their life on the line. But it makes me so angry that we never stop to think about the fact that we shouldn¡¯t be asking average civilians to be heroes. I don¡¯t want my husband or my children to have to be heroes.¡± Ms. Watts pushed back against responses to mass shootings that call for more people to be armed with more weapons, noting that America has a gun homicide rate that is 26 times that of its peer nations. ¡°There are 400 million guns in this country,¡± she said. ¡°If guns made us safer, we¡¯d be the safest nation in the world.¡± During unfolding attacks, colleges and police departments now sometimes post on social media urging people to ¡°Run, Hide, Fight,¡± and the phrase has become a staple of active shooter training sessions offered at schools, businesses and religious venues. The phrase, which the federal government adopted from the city of Houston, has caught on. Katherine Schweit, a former F.B.I. official who helped develop the federal guidelines, said training with that philosophy allowed people to think through how they might want to respond long before they encountered a gunman. ¡°No one should ever be told you must fight ? you can¡¯t ask that of anybody,¡± Ms. Schweit said. ¡°But you can talk to them about how people have survived, and not in small numbers. A lot of people have survived when individuals have taken it upon themselves to intervene.¡± Jeffrey Kranz, the assistant police chief at Marquette University in Milwaukee, said ¡°Run, Hide, Fight¡± training was now required for incoming freshmen. But most of them, he said, had already received similar advice growing up. ¡°It¡¯s the modern-day fire drill that we went through as kids,¡± Chief Kranz said. Chief Kranz said he had been teaching active shooter response for about 15 years. But in recent years, he said, he has been struck by the increasing number of students who tell him that they had a direct connection to a mass shooting. ¡°I am always surprised now at how many people have had some level of exposure,¡± he said. ¡°A family member, they were present at one of these events, they know somebody that was part of one of these events.¡± Edward Davis, a former Boston police commissioner who was head of the department at the time of the Boston Marathon bombing, said that there had been a shift in thinking from Americans trying to head off mass shootings and rampant gun violence. ¡°People now think differently not just about being in public spaces but private spaces, as well,¡± he said. ¡°People have a self-preservation gene, and that gene has gotten stronger. It¡¯s turning into a Wild West survival mentality.¡± ¡°I haven¡¯t carried a gun since I retired in 2013, but I¡¯m thinking about doing it again when I¡¯m out in public,¡± he said. Mike Wright was the manager of the Luca Pizza di Roma in a Greenwood, Ind., shopping mall in July 2022 when a gunman emerged from a bathroom and opened fire, killing three people before he was fatally shot by an armed bystander, Elisjsha Dicken, who was carrying his 9-millimeter handgun. Mr. Wright praised Mr. Dicken as a ¡°hero citizen¡± who saved lives but said those, like himself, who had survived were still changed. ¡°It¡¯s nothing you ever expect to go through, but now we live in a heinous world,¡± he said. He added: ¡°Since then, I watch my back more. You never know when someone is going to pop up.¡± Guy A. Relford, an Indiana lawyer who focuses on Second Amendment issues, represents Mr. Dicken. Mr. Relford said the effect on those hailed as heroes can be intense, too. ¡°Generally, from representing people in his situation, it¡¯s a profound thing and a tough situation to deal with,¡± he said. ¡°Any person who values human life is going to be impacted by making that decision.¡± Americans  have increasingly turned to active shooter training to learn strategies for surviving an attack. In Odessa, Texas, on Tuesday evening, a small group of residents gathered at the Odessa Police Department for a session on how to react if confronted by a gunman. The session opened with a graphic showing the increase in mass shootings across the United States, from the early 2000s to now. Cpl. Steven LeSueur told participants it takes about three minutes for the police to respond to a shooting. What happens in those minutes can mean the difference between life, injury, or death, he said, and if people decide to fight, they need to be prepared. Joanna Wright, 61, looked on with her family nearby. She was shaken by a mass shooting around Odessa in 2019, which occurred near her grandchildren¡¯s home. She attended the course on Tuesday knowing that another shooting could always take place. ¡°It taught me to refresh my brain and always be alert because you never know where or when,¡± she said.

It expired in 2004 and any new proposals are unlikely to pass a divided Senate. By John Yoon As Californians were dealing with a mass shooting in Monterey Park, the White House on Monday said it was renewing a push for sweeping gun control measures in the Senate that would renew the assault weapons ban that expired in 2004. ¡°Communities across America have been struck by tragedy after tragedy, including mass shootings from Colorado Springs to Monterey Park,¡± President Biden said in a statement. Just moments later, a gunman killed seven people in Half Moon Bay, Calif. The 1994 ban, which passed as part of a broader crime bill championed by Mr. Biden, then a senator, blocked the sale of 19 specific weapons that have the features of guns used by the military, including semiautomatic rifles and certain types of shotguns and handguns. It also outlawed magazines that can hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition. People who already had such weapons were allowed to keep them. Mass-shooting fatalities were dramatically less likely to occur in the United States during the decade the ban was in effect, a 2019 study by researchers at New York University Grossman School of Medicine showed. But the assault weapons ban was contentious. The N.R.A. and Republicans have vigorously opposed it, arguing that it is ineffective and that it infringes on the Second Amendment. In 2004, Congress allowed it to expire amid lobbying by the N.R.A. and gun-rights activists. After almost every mass shooting since, there has been an effort in Congress to bring back the ban. But all have failed in the face of Republican opposition. The White House statement came after the House, then controlled by the Democrats, passed legislation in July that aimed to renew a ban on assault weapons. But it stood no chance of passing in the divided Senate. Senator Dianne Feinstein of California has now introduced legislation that would ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, and raise the purchasing age to 21, the White House statement said. ¡°I urge both chambers of Congress to act quickly and deliver this Assault Weapons Ban to my desk,¡± Mr. Biden said.

Pearson to the state legislature, less than a week after he and a colleague were expelled. By Emily Cochrane NASHVILLE ? Local officials unanimously voted on Wednesday to send Justin J. Pearson, one of two Black Democratic representatives ousted from the Tennessee House of Representatives after a gun control protest on the House floor, back to his seat in the state legislature. The vote came less than a week after Mr. Pearson of Memphis and State Representative Justin Jones of Nashville were abruptly expelled from the legislature, just the third time such a punishment has been used in the state House since the Civil War era. Angered by the disruption of the protest and the disregard for House rules, Republicans quickly moved to expel the pair, though an effort to remove Representative Gloria Johnson, a white lawmaker from Knoxville, failed. The expulsions of two of the chamber¡¯s youngest Black lawmakers infuriated Democrats, who were already frustrated with their inability to counter the Republican supermajority, and further galvanized the hundreds of demonstrators who repeatedly marched to the State Capitol to call for tougher gun laws after the Covenant School shooting that left three students and three staff members dead. Officials on the Shelby County Board of Commissioners said they had received thousands of emails and calls from around the county, the country and the world, pleading with them to reappoint Mr. Pearson. ¡°I want to commend you for standing up for the things that matter to the people of Shelby County and the state of Tennessee,¡± Commissioner Shante Avant said to Mr. Pearson at Wednesday¡¯s board hearing. ¡°You have done well by us in making sure that our voices can be heard.¡± The unanimous vote by the seven Democrats allows Mr. Pearson to be sworn in to his seat as early as Thursday, ahead of a special election later this year. The board¡¯s four Republicans were absent and did not vote. Both Mr. Jones and Mr. Pearson have vowed to run for their seats later this year in special elections. Mr. Jones has already returned to the State Capitol, triumphantly taking his oath on the building¡¯s steps on Monday after the Metropolitan Council of Nashville and Davidson County unanimously voted to name him as an interim representative. Mr. Pearson, who rallied with hundreds of supporters as he marched to Wednesday¡¯s meeting, was relatively new to the legislature after winning a special election in late January. Supporters packed the commission hearing room and cheered when the vote passed, after Mr. Pearson¡¯s father offered a prayer for those present. ¡°We¡¯ve got people that we have an allegiance to, who are willing to march for justice, who are willing to fight for justice, who are willing to vote for justice, and it is that spirit which I will head back to Nashville with,¡± Mr. Pearson said after the vote, surrounded by his family. ¡°You can¡¯t expel hope,¡± he added. ¡°You can¡¯t expel justice.¡± In a sign of the continued Democratic outrage at the expulsions, five U.S. senators, including Chuck Schumer of New York, the majority leader, and Raphael Warnock of Georgia, on Wednesday asked the Justice Department to investigate whether the civil rights of Mr. Jones, Mr. Pearson or their constituents had been violated. As protesters continue to pressure the legislature to move to tighten access to guns in the state, Republican lawmakers have largely focused on legislation that would pour millions of dollars into security at both public and private schools. But on Tuesday, Gov. Bill Lee, a Republican, announced he would sign an executive order tightening background checks for buying guns in the state and speeding up the process of reviewing criminal histories and mental health information from the courts. Mr. Lee also called on the legislature to draft and pass what he described as ¡°an order of protection law¡± that would ensure that people found by a judge to be a danger to themselves or others would not have access to guns. He repeatedly declined to refer to the measure as a red flag law, a term some conservatives have resisted both on the state and the national level, instead describing it as ¡°a law that I think is appropriate for our state today.¡± He has been open about the personal impact of the attack at the Covenant School: His wife, Maria, was close friends with Cindy Peak, one of the staff members killed, and the two women were set to have dinner the night of the shooting. Lt. Gov. Randy McNally, a Republican, has also expressed support for a red flag law after the Covenant School shooting. Police officials had pointedly noted that while the parents of the shooter believed their child should not own any guns, particularly while receiving treatment for an unspecified emotional disorder, there was no law in Tennessee that could have allowed them to confiscate any weapons. ¡°The governor is right to make this a priority before session ends,¡± said State Senator Raumesh Akbari, a Memphis Democrat and the minority leader. She added, ¡°We are ready to work with the governor and we urge our Republican colleagues in the legislature to move quickly to put gun reform legislation on his desk.¡± Some Republicans in the state legislature have signaled opposition, warning that such a law could deprive people of individual due process. Nearly 20 states have passed a version of a red flag law, many of them after the 2018 school shooting in Parkland, Fla. State House Speaker Cameron Sexton did not openly weigh in on the measure, instead saying in a statement that any order of protection ¡°must have a level of due process, protections from fraudulent claims and a quick judicial hearing for individuals who pose imminent threats.¡± ¡°The House is willing to work toward bipartisan solutions to protect all children at their schools, in their communities and inside their homes,¡± he added. The Tennessee Firearms Association, however, declared that ¡°this is not a time to follow a call to passing something, anything now to show the ¡®mob¡¯ that Tennessee government responds to emotional calls for gun control.¡± When Mr. Lee announced support for legislation toughening school security this month, he was flanked by his Republican colleagues. But on Tuesday, he stood alone at a Metropolitan Nashville Police precinct, in front of a banner thanking officers for their swift response to the Covenant School attack. That unaccompanied appearance raised questions about the depth of Republican support for taking weapons away from people deemed to be dangerous. ¡°It¡¯s going to require coming together, laying down our previously held positions potentially, and it really is just going to require finding the things that we agree upon together,¡± Mr. Lee said. But he acknowledged that the General Assembly ¡°will determine what that process looks like for them.¡± Emily Cochrane is a national correspondent covering the American South, based in Nashville.

By Annie Karni WASHINGTON ? Supporters of gun control lashed out at President Biden on Friday for suggesting a day earlier that gun legislation would not be his next priority even after two mass shootings in a week. Mr. Biden initially said on Tuesday that he did not need to ¡°wait another minute¡± to address the epidemic of gun violence, calling on the Senate to pass a ban on assault weapons and to close background check loopholes. But on Thursday, at the first formal news conference of his presidency, Mr. Biden left gun control proponents dumbstruck and disappointed when he said the key to legislative success was ordering priorities, and that infrastructure ? not guns ? was next on his list. ¡°I¡¯m disappointed he has the nerve and audacity to say he¡¯s going to do things in sequential order,¡± said Maisha Fields, the vice president of organizing for Brady: United Against Gun Violence, a nonprofit group. ¡°It¡¯s out of order to have to bury your child. It¡¯s out of order to be shopping for eggs and to have your life disrupted.¡± At his news conference, Mr. Biden was asked specifically about his plans for promoting gun legislation or using executive actions on the issue. In response, he pivoted to a lengthy explanation of why infrastructure was a bigger priority for him. To some, the response was a pragmatic approach by a president dealing with crises on multiple fronts and a blockade of opposition by Republicans to any gun control measures. But gun control supporters said they were appalled by his shift in tone from a year ago, when Mr. Biden said on the campaign trail that ¡°every day that we do nothing in response, it is an insult to the innumerable lives across this nation that have been forever shattered by gun violence.¡± During the campaign, Mr. Biden also promised on his first day in office to send a bill to Congress that would repeal liability protections for gun manufacturers and close background-check loopholes. He has not done so yet, 65 days into his term. ¡°I was very frustrated that he pivoted to infrastructure week,¡± said Igor Volsky, the founder of Gun Down America. That the administration has not approached gun legislation with the same intensity that it brought to its $1.9 trillion pandemic rescue plan ? which passed with no Republican support ? only added to his frustration, he said. ¡°We saw what they can do when they hit the gas pedal,¡± Mr. Volsky said. ¡°They got it across despite unanimous opposition. That¡¯s the kind of leadership we need to see on this issue.¡± The House passed two gun control bills this month but they are languishing in the Senate in the face of Republican opposition and the chamber¡¯s 60-vote threshold for passing most legislation. ¡°This crisis is beyond any other crisis we¡¯ve seen,¡± said Greg Jackson, the national advocacy director for the Community Justice Action Fund, a group focused on gun violence in communities of color. After the 2012 shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown. Conn., where 20 children and six adults were murdered, President Barack Obama vowed to press Congress to ban military-style assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, expand background checks and toughen gun-trafficking laws. He has described his failure to pass any legislation as one of his biggest regrets. In 2019, President Donald J. Trump briefly said he would push for what he described as ¡°very meaningful background checks,¡± after a pair of deadly mass shootings in Texas and Ohio. But after discussions with officials from the National Rifle Association, he reversed himself, saying he was concerned with protecting the Second Amendment and that the country had ¡°very strong background checks right now.¡± Notably absent from the public chorus of disapproval on Friday was Everytown for Gun Safety, one of the most influential gun violence prevention organizations in the country. While John Feinblatt, the group¡¯s president, has been encouraging Mr. Biden to act immediately, he has so far not openly criticized him for a delay. A spokeswoman for Everytown, Stacey Radnor, said the group was continuing to work closely with the White House to carry out executive actions and pressure Congress to act. Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said at a news briefing on Friday that Mr. Biden understood the frustration among gun control proponents. But, she added, that ¡°frustration should be vented at the members of the House and Senate who voted against the measures the president supports, and we¡¯d certainly support their advocacy in that regard.¡± Po Murray, chairwoman of the Newtown Action Alliance, said the administration¡¯s ¡°inconsistent¡± messaging was a problem. ¡°We¡¯re trying to figure out what¡¯s happening here,¡± she said. ¡°We pushed for it, we supported him, we expected a better response after the election.¡± The administration has been working on three executive actions on guns but has yet to roll them out. One would classify so-called ghost guns ? kits that allow a gun to be assembled from pieces ? as firearms, which would require their sales to be subject to background checks. Another would fund community violence intervention programs, and the third would strengthen the background checks system, according to congressional aides familiar with the conversations. Ms. Psaki declined to provide a timetable for any executive actions. Some gun control supporters also said they wanted to see a more senior official at the White House overseeing the issue. Susan E. Rice, the director of Mr. Biden¡¯s Domestic Policy Council, has been serving as the internal point person on efforts addressing gun violence. But Mr. Obama put his vice president, Mr. Biden, in charge of the issue after the Sandy Hook shootings. Ms. Murray said she had the perfect figure in mind to serve as Mr. Biden¡¯s point person on the issue. ¡°We¡¯ll take Barack Obama,¡± she said. Annie Karni is a White House correspondent.

By J. David Goodman AUSTIN, Texas ? What had for years been a solid wall of opposition among Texas Republicans to gun control showed small signs of cracking on Monday as a bipartisan committee of the State Legislature voted to advance a bill raising the minimum age to purchase AR-15-style rifles. The preliminary vote was remarkable in a State Capitol dominated by Republicans, all the more so because it had been entirely unexpected: When the day began, the 13-member committee had not been scheduled to meet at all. But the killing of eight people, including several children, at a shopping center in Allen, Texas, on Saturday has exerted an unexpectedly raw and emotional force on the Legislature. The shooting, by a man with an AR-15-style rifle, came just over a week after the killing of five people by their neighbor with an AR-15-style rifle in a home north of Houston, and just shy of a year after 19 children and two teachers were killed by an 18-year-old gunman armed with an AR-15-style rifle in Uvalde, Texas. ¡°It was the most emotional vote I¡¯ve ever taken, and I started crying after I made it,¡± said State Representative Sam Harless, a Republican from the Houston area who voted to keep the bill moving toward the House floor. ¡°That means my heart told me I made the right vote.¡± The bill, which would raise the age to purchase an AR-15-style rifle from 18 to 21, must still be considered by the entire Texas House, with deadlines to do so looming this week. Even if it were to pass ? still an unlikely prospect ? it would face almost certain rejection by the State Senate, where the hard-right lieutenant governor, Dan Patrick, holds powerful control. Republican leaders in Texas have long opposed measures to restrict guns and in recent legislative sessions have eased the rules around firearms, including passage of a 2021 law allowing adults to carry handguns without a permit. But on a day of shouting and tears in the Texas Capitol in the wake of the latest mass shooting, the vote signaled that the unrelenting pace of mass murder that has plagued the state in recent years has had an impact on legislators, however slight. Since the start of 2021 in Texas, there have been more than a dozen mass killings of four or more people. ¡°The change of heart and the change of face on this vote today was not accidental,¡± said Representative Trey Martinez Fischer, the chair of the House Democratic Caucus. ¡°It is a reflection of the pressure that is building in this building and just hit a tipping point¡± after the killings on Saturday. Some Republicans in the State House on Monday talked privately of a new ¡°openness¡± to the bill raising the age for purchasing of semiautomatic rifles, which had appeared destined to languish in committee despite relentless lobbying in favor of the measure by relatives of the children killed in Uvalde. But only a handful of Republican legislators ultimately voted to move the bill forward. Those who voted against the bill did so without comment. In condemning Saturday¡¯s shootings, Republicans have not addressed the availability of guns, focusing instead on the mental health of the gunman. Gov. Greg Abbott demurred when asked during a news conference on Monday what could be done to get guns out of the hands of potential mass shooters. He has previously said that age restrictions on adult purchases of weapons would be likely to be found unconstitutional. Representative Keith Self, a Republican member of Congress from the Allen area, said previously, in an interview on CNN, that those who would question the effectiveness of offering prayers in response to a mass shooting ¡°don¡¯t believe in an almighty God who is absolutely in control of our lives.¡± Though there have been some signs of gradual shifting on the issue, Republican primary voters in Texas continue to broadly support lawful access to firearms with limited restrictions, and most elected officials in Texas have more to fear from a primary challenge by a more ardent supporter of gun rights than from a general election fight with Democrats. Last year¡¯s convincing defeat by Mr. Abbott of Beto O¡¯Rourke, a former Democratic congressman closely associated with greater gun regulation, inspired little appetite among Republican lawmakers for new legislation. The election took place after the massacre in Uvalde. Still, Democrats and advocates for gun control had for months been pushing hard for the legislation on raising the purchasing age, known as House Bill 2744. The shooting in Allen provided new anger and new resolve. At the start of the day on Monday, more than a hundred protesters lined the halls and stairs approaching the House chamber, and their chants of ¡°Raise the age!¡± echoed throughout the soaring rotunda. Lobbyists and legislators said they could not recall such an animated showing of gun control supporters in the Capitol. At the other end of the hall, Democratic representatives and state senators, some dressed in black in a sign of mourning for the victims of Saturday¡¯s shooting, held a news conference flanked by relatives of children killed at the Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, images of their dead children staring out from photos and T-shirts. Some said they had been traveling to Austin nearly every week since the legislative session began. ¡°I don¡¯t come here and ask you to bring my child back,¡± said Nikki Cross, the aunt and legal guardian of Uziyah Garcia, who was killed in Uvalde. ¡°The one small, very simple ask that we¡¯ve had is to just raise the age limit to purchase assault-style weapons,¡± she said, speaking through tears. The legislation would not have been a factor in the shooting in Allen, where the gunman was 33 years old. But it might have delayed or prevented the gunman in Uvalde from obtaining his weapons; he waited until his 18th birthday and legally purchased a pair of AR-15-style weapons soon after, and then used one of them inside the school. As the proceedings were getting underway on Monday, Democrats and Republicans gathered at the front of the House chamber around Jeff Leach, a six-term Republican representative from Allen who said that he did not know how much longer he would be serving. ¡°Increasingly I¡¯m finding freedom in saying what I think,¡± he said, his voice quavering at one point. ¡°So I¡¯m going to say something this morning. There¡¯s a lot we don¡¯t know, but one thing I do know is that this is happening way too much, and it doesn¡¯t have to be this way.¡± He stopped short of endorsing any particular measure but said the House should consider ¡°all of the potential solutions.¡± After the shooting on Saturday, several Democrats began thinking and discussing avenues for possibly forcing a vote on the House floor, expecting that the bill would never clear the House Select Committee on Community, where it had been stalled. Several members planned to take up the matter very publicly on the floor as soon as Mr. Leach was finished speaking. Republican leaders learned of the imminent parliamentary move on Monday morning, according to several people with knowledge of the proceedings. In an apparent effort to avoid a public fight over guns, they instead hastily convened an unplanned meeting of the committee to consider House Bill 2744. The bill passed, 8 to 5, with two Republicans voting for it, including Mr. Harless and Representative Justin Holland, who represents parts of Collin County, where Allen is located. The bill will not immediately come before the full House. It first must be put on the calendar, and little time remains. The last day for the House to pass its own bills is Thursday, though some Democrats believe they have other procedural means of forcing a vote before the end of the legislative session on May 29. After the committee vote on Monday, cheers erupted from the room, which was packed with Uvalde relatives and gun control advocates. Several hugged and cried. ¡°I have kids and I have a granddaughter, and I have grade schools in my area,¡± Mr. Harless said in an interview. ¡°I want to know when I go home at night I¡¯ve done everything I can to keep the kids I represent safe.¡± Asked about his Republican colleagues, he said his constituents differed from those in more rural areas. He said he could not predict whether the bill would ultimately pass. ¡°We¡¯ll have to wait and see, but this is a big step forward,¡± he said. ¡°We just need to make sure that we do everything we can to stop some of these senseless shootings that are going on.¡± J.

By Sarah Mervosh and Campbell Robertson The 6-year-old boy who is accused of bringing a gun to school and shooting his teacher in Newport News, Va., this month has an ¡°acute disability¡± and had been under an intensive care plan at school, his family said on Thursday in its first statement since the shooting on Jan. 6. The statement, released through the family¡¯s lawyer, said that the boy had previously been accompanied in school each day by his mother or father as part of the plan for his disability, and that the week of the shooting was the first time that a parent was not in class with him. ¡°We will regret our absence on this day for the rest of our lives,¡± the family said in a statement. The statement also said that the gun, which the authorities said the boy brought from home, had been ¡°secured,¡± but did not explain how the boy had gotten access to it. The police declined to comment. No one has been charged in the case so far, a spokeswoman for the Newport News Police Department said on Thursday. The Newport News school district declined to comment, citing student privacy. The new details add context to a painful case in which the police say the 6-year-old obtained a handgun at home, brought it to Richneck Elementary School and pulled the trigger in his first-grade classroom, seriously injuring his teacher, Abigail Zwerner, 25. She has been released from the hospital. The child¡¯s history also raises questions about the school¡¯s response on the day of the shooting, when district officials say that an employee at Richneck Elementary, acting on a tip, searched the boy¡¯s backpack for a gun. No weapon was found at that time, the school district said. Later, around 2 p.m., the police said, the boy held up a handgun in his first-grade classroom and fired one shot at his teacher. The case, unusual because of the child¡¯s young age, spurred new conversation around school security and access to guns, in an era of increasing school shootings. Richneck Elementary has been closed since the shooting, and the school district announced it would install metal detectors in all school buildings, including elementary schools. In the statement, the family said it had been committed to ¡°responsible gun ownership and keeping firearms out of the reach of children.¡± The police have said that the handgun was legally purchased by the child¡¯s mother. Virginia law prohibits leaving a loaded gun where it is accessible to children under 14, a crime that is punishable as a misdemeanor. ¡°Our heart goes out to our son¡¯s teacher and we pray for her healing,¡± the boy¡¯s family said in the statement, adding that Ms. Zwerner had ¡°worked diligently and compassionately to support our family as we sought the best education and learning environment for our son.¡± The boy has also been ¡°under hospital care and receiving the treatment he needs,¡± his family said. ¡°We continue to pray for his teacher¡¯s full recovery, and for her loved ones who are undoubtedly upset and concerned,¡± the family said. ¡°At the same time, we love our son and are asking that you please include him and our family in your prayers.¡± Paul Bibeau contributed reporting.

Under what, under what?¡± ¡°Ma¡¯am, back up, get on the ?¡± ¡°Under what law are you arresting her?¡± A question looming over the last four years ? whether Trumpism would outlast Trump ? was answered emphatically with the passage of a new law in Georgia curbing voting access for state residents, redefining a national debate on terms dictated by the former president. The measure, passed weeks after former President Donald J. Trump tried to overturn President Biden¡¯s victory in the state, was very much in line with Mr. Trump¡¯s false claims that expanded voter access had led to widespread fraud and, in turn, his defeat. In a statement on Friday, Mr. Biden condemned the law as ¡°un-American¡± and ¡°Jim Crow in the 21st century.¡± ¡°It¡¯s an atrocity,¡± he told reporters outside the White House before leaving for Delaware. ¡°If you want any indication that it has nothing to do with fairness, nothing to do with decency, they passed a law saying you can¡¯t provide water for people standing in line while they¡¯re waiting to vote. You don¡¯t need anything else to know that this is nothing but punitive, designed to keep people from voting.¡± Asked after landing in Delaware whether the White House could do anything to safeguard voting rights in Georgia, the president responded: ¡°Well, we¡¯re working on that right now. We don¡¯t know quite exactly what we can do at this point. The Justice Department¡¯s taking a look as well.¡± He did not specify whether law enforcement officials were examining the new law itself. The law, signed on Thursday by the Republican governor, Brian Kemp ? who was browbeaten by Mr. Trump for not supporting the effort to overturn the election ? introduces more rigid voter identification requirements for absentee balloting, limits drop boxes and expands the legislature¡¯s power over elections. It will have an outsize impact on Black voters, who make up roughly one-third of Georgia¡¯s population and vote overwhelmingly Democratic. The legislation followed Democratic victories that flipped the state at the presidential and Senate levels, and was part of a national push in Republican-controlled state legislatures for the most extensive contraction of voting access in generations. ¡°The Republican Party was transformed under Donald Trump in a way that won¡¯t be reversed anytime soon ? fanning grievance, disregarding the truth and perpetuating the myth that Trump¡¯s votes weren¡¯t counted,¡± said Ben LaBolt, an adviser to former President Barack Obama in the White House and on his campaigns. ¡°The Georgia law is part of this battle.¡± Mr. Trump welcomed the law in a statement and invoked his baseless claims of widespread voter fraud, complaining that the rule changes would have helped him if they had been enacted sooner. In the short term, Republican lawmakers say they have regained the political initiative by applying pressure in statehouses. Their efforts have, indeed, prompted an internal Democratic dispute over scrapping the filibuster to void the state-level efforts to restrict voting access. But in the long term, Democrats think the strategy could prompt a progressive backlash that would invigorate their party¡¯s base. In a scene with echoes of the civil rights era, Senator Raphael Warnock, Georgia¡¯s first Black senator since Reconstruction, visited a Democratic state legislator in jail on Thursday after she was arrested for lightly knocking on Mr. Kemp¡¯s door as he was signing the bill. ¡°What we have witnessed today is a very desperate attempt to lock out and squeeze the people out of their own democracy,¡± Mr. Warnock said after visiting State Representative Park Cannon in the Fulton County Jail. ¡°The people are being locked down and locked out of their own democracy,¡± Mr. Warnock said, adding that the new law only reinforced the determination of Black voters to have their voices heard. Asked about Ms. Cannon¡¯s arrest, Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said on Friday, ¡°I think anyone who saw that video would have been deeply concerned by the actions that were taken by law enforcement.¡± ? Glenn Thrush,?Nick Corasaniti and Thomas Kaplan  Supporters of gun control lashed out at President Biden on Friday for suggesting that gun legislation would not be his next priority even after two mass shootings in a week. Mr. Biden had initially said on Tuesday that he did not need to ¡°wait another minute¡± to address the epidemic of gun violence, calling on the Senate to pass a ban on assault weapons and to close background check loopholes. But on Thursday, at the first formal news conference of his presidency, Mr. Biden left gun control proponents dumbstruck and disappointed when he said that the key to legislative success was ordering priorities, and that infrastructure was next on his list. ¡°I¡¯m disappointed he has the nerve and audacity to say he¡¯s going to do things in sequential order,¡± said Maisha Fields, the vice president of organizing for Brady: United Against Gun Violence, a nonprofit group. ¡°It¡¯s out of order to have to bury your child. It¡¯s out of order to be shopping for eggs and to have your life disrupted.¡± Greg Jackson, the national advocacy director for the Community Justice Action Fund, a group focused on gun violence in communities of color, said, ¡°This crisis is beyond any other crisis we¡¯ve seen.¡± At the news conference, Mr. Biden was asked about his plans for promoting gun legislation or taking executive actions on the issue. In response, he pivoted to a lengthy explanation of why infrastructure was a bigger priority. To some, the response reflected a pragmatic approach by a president dealing with crises on multiple fronts and Republican opposition to any gun control measures. But gun control supporters said they were appalled by Mr. Biden¡¯s shift in tone from a year ago, when he said on the campaign trail, ¡°Every day that we do nothing in response, it is an insult to the innumerable lives across this nation that have been forever shattered by gun violence.¡± Mr. Biden had also promised to send a bill to Congress on his first day in office that would repeal liability protections for gun manufacturers and close background-check loopholes. He has not done so yet, 65 days into his term. The House passed two gun control bills this month, but they are languishing in the Senate in the face of Republican opposition and the chamber¡¯s 60-vote threshold for passing most legislation. ? Annie Karni  As President Biden signaled this week that he would let a May 1 deadline pass without withdrawing American troops from Afghanistan, some officials are using an intelligence assessment to argue for prolonging the military mission there. American intelligence agencies have told the Biden administration that if U.S. troops leave before a power-sharing settlement is reached between the Taliban and the Afghan government, the country could fall largely under the control of the Taliban within two or three years after the withdrawal of international forces. That could potentially open the door for Al Qaeda to rebuild its strength within the country, according to American officials. The classified assessment, first prepared last year for the Trump administration but not previously disclosed, is the latest in a series of grim predictions about Afghanistan¡¯s future that intelligence analysts have delivered throughout the two-decade-long war. But the intelligence has landed in a changed political environment. While President Donald J. Trump pushed for a withdrawal of all forces even before the terms of the peace deal required it, Mr. Biden has been more cautious. He said Thursday that he did not view May 1 as a strict deadline, although he said he ¡°could not picture¡± troops being in the country next year. The decision looms as one of the most critical of Mr. Biden¡¯s young presidency. When he was vice president, he argued for a minimal presence in Afghanistan, but he is said to have privately described as haunting the possibility of allowing the country to descend into chaos. Some senior Biden administration officials have expressed skepticism of any intelligence prediction that Al Qaeda or the Islamic State will resurge in Afghanistan. Taliban commanders remain opposed to the Islamic State, and Al Qaeda, which has little current presence in the country, could regroup instead in any number of lawless regions around the world. Also left unanswered by the intelligence warning is the question of whether Afghanistan could really prosper if American troops remained indefinitely. Their presence would most likely prevent a collapse of the Afghan security forces and allow the government in Kabul, the capital, to retain control of major cities. But the Taliban would still be likely to gradually expand their power in other parts of the country, including curbing the rights of women. The White House will continue to hold meetings on Afghanistan. On Thursday, Mr. Biden said he was waiting for briefings from Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken for advice. ? Julian E. Barnes,?Thomas Gibbons-Neff and Eric Schmitt  President Biden on Friday invited 40 world leaders, including Presidents Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and Xi Jinping of China, to participate in a climate summit next month. The summit will begin on Earth Day, April 22. Like all of Mr. Biden¡¯s international meetings so far, it will be held virtually, and a White House announcement said it would be ¡°live streamed for public viewing.¡± That format may ensure a fair bit of public posturing by the leaders on how climate is an issue on which they can all work together ? and it eliminates the potential problem of ¡°pull aside¡± meetings on other topics with American adversaries. Over the past 10 days, Mr. Biden has called Mr. Putin a ¡°killer¡± and said that Mr. Xi did not have a democratic ¡°bone in his body.¡± But he has promised to cooperate with them on common challenges. The summit is part of an effort to get the United States and its partners back on track after Mr. Biden re-entered the Paris agreement, the global pact intended to avert catastrophic global warming. It is his chance to galvanize efforts to reduce emissions, set standards for limiting the warming of the atmosphere, and make good on his promise that efforts to stem climate change can also create jobs. Among the invitees are the leaders of all the United States¡¯ major European and Asian allies, along with Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India and the leaders of some tiny nations such as Bhutan and the Marshall Islands. Mr. Biden invited King Salman of Saudi Arabia but not the de facto leader of the country, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The United States said in an intelligence report last month that Prince Mohammed had approved the operation that led to the killing of the journalist and dissident Jamal Khashoggi, which had prompted an international outcry. ? David E. Sanger  Speaker Nancy Pelosi appointed Maj. Gen. William J. Walker, the commander of the District of Columbia National Guard, as the House sergeant-at-arms on Friday, a move that will place the security of both chambers of Congress in the hands of accomplished military leaders after the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. General Walker will become the first Black person to lead security in the House in its 232-year history. ¡°General William Walker has proven to be a leader of great integrity and experience who will bring his steady and patriotic leadership to this vital role,¡± Ms. Pelosi said in a statement. ¡°His historic appointment as the first Black American to serve as sergeant-at-arms is an important step forward for this institution and our nation.¡± Ms. Pelosi added that General Walker¡¯s experience would ¡°be an important asset to the House, particularly in light of the Jan. 6 insurrection.¡± General Walker, who served for 30 years as a National Guardsman and a Drug Enforcement Administration agent, most recently led both the Army and Air Force components of the District of Columbia National Guard. In that role, he ensured that troops were ready to respond to national emergencies, including deployments to Iraq, Afghanistan, Guant?namo Bay, Poland and Saudi Arabia. As guard commander, he oversaw the 113th Wing, which secures the skies over the nation¡¯s capital, and the C-40 Clipper, which provides air transportation for members of Congress and other dignitaries. After a mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, he spoke out against what he called ¡°unusual¡± restrictions placed on the National Guard beforehand, saying the military¡¯s fears of a repeat of aggressive tactics used during racial justice protests last year had slowed decision-making and squandered time as the violence escalated. In testimony this month before a Senate committee, General Walker said he had not received approval to mobilize troops to respond to the riot until more than three hours after he requested it. General Walker added that he could have dispatched 150 troops to the Capitol complex hours earlier. The violent rampage, which unfolded over nearly five hours, caused injuries to nearly 140 police officers and led to at least five deaths. In the Senate, another former military leader, the retired Army Lt. Gen. Karen Gibson, took office as sergeant-at-arms this week. ? Luke Broadwater  The calculus around vaccine production is about to change, with significant and unpredictable political and policy implications. Vaccine manufacturers have been steadily increasing their output, and states have snapped up new doses as quickly as the government could deliver them. But officials expect the supply of vaccines to outstrip U.S. demand by mid-May, if not sooner, and are grappling with what to do with looming surpluses when scarcity turns to glut. President Biden has promised enough doses by the end of May to immunize all of the nation¡¯s adults. But between then and the end of July, the government has locked in commitments from manufacturers for doses to cover another 100 million people ? totaling  tens of millions more than the nation¡¯s entire population. Whether to keep, modify or redirect those orders is a question with significant implications, not just for the nation¡¯s efforts to contain the virus, but also for how soon the pandemic can be brought to an end. Of the vaccine doses given globally, about three-quarters have gone to only 10 countries. At least 30 countries have not yet injected a single person. And global scarcity threatens to grow more acute as nations and regions clamp down on vaccine exports. With infections  soaring, India¡¯s government is holding back nearly all of the 2.4 million daily doses manufactured by the Serum Institute of India, the private company that is one of the world¡¯s largest producers of the AstraZeneca vaccine. That action follows the European Union¡¯s decision this week to move emergency legislation that would curb vaccine exports for the next six weeks. Biden administration officials who are inclined to hold on to the coming U.S. surplus point to unmet need and rising uncertainty: Children and adolescents are still unvaccinated, and no one is certain whether or when immunity could wear off, which could require scores of millions of booster shots. Vaccine manufacturers and some top federal officials say decisions about what to do with extra vaccine orders must be made within weeks, or the uncertainty could slow production lines. The manufacturing process can take up to 10 weeks, so changes for a foreign market need time. The regulatory rules that govern vaccine shipments present another hurdle, as does the limited storage life of the drug substances that make the vaccine. Senior officials say the administration is leaning toward keeping the doses it has ordered, and at some point directing the excess to other nations in one-off deals or giving it to Covax, an international nonprofit backed by the World Health Organization that is trying to coordinate equitable vaccine distribution. The Biden administration has already donated $4 billion to that international effort. ? Sharon LaFraniere and Noah Weiland  If the so-called Stop the Steal movement appeared to be chasing a lost cause once President Biden was inaugurated, its supporters among extremist organizations are now adopting a new agenda from the anti-vaccination campaign to try to undermine the government. Adherents of far-right groups who cluster online have turned repeatedly to one particular website in recent weeks ? the federal database showing deaths and adverse reactions nationwide among people who have received Covid-19 vaccinations. Although negative reactions have been relatively rare, the numbers are used by many extremist groups to try to bolster a rash of false and alarmist disinformation in articles and videos with titles like ¡°Covid-19 Vaccines Are Weapons of Mass Destruction ? and Could Wipe out the Human Race¡± or ¡°Doctors and Nurses Giving the Covid-19 Vaccine Will be Tried as War Criminals.¡± Bashing of the safety and efficacy of vaccines is occurring in chat rooms frequented by all manner of right-wing groups, including the Proud Boys; the Boogaloo movement, a loose affiliation known for wanting to spark a second Civil War; and various paramilitary organizations. These groups tend to portray vaccines as a symbol of excessive government control. ¡°If less people get vaccinated, then the system will have to use more aggressive force on the rest of us to make us get the shot,¡± read a recent post on the Telegram social media platform, in a channel linked to members of the Proud Boys charged in storming the Capitol. The marked focus on vaccines is particularly striking on discussion channels populated by followers of QAnon, who had falsely prophesied that Donald J. Trump would continue as president while his political opponents were marched off to jail. ¡°They rode the shift in the national conversation away from Trump to what was happening with the massive ramp up in vaccines,¡± said Devin Burghart, the head of the Seattle-based Institute for Research and Education on Human Rights, which monitors far-right movements. ¡°It allowed them to pivot away from the failure of their previous prophecy to focus on something else.¡± Apocalyptic warnings about the vaccine feed into the far-right narrative that the government cannot be trusted, the sentiment also at the root of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. The more vaccine opponents succeed in preventing or at least delaying herd immunity, experts noted, the longer it will take for life to return to normal and that will further undermine faith in the government and its institutions. Last spring, a common purpose among far-right activists and the anti-vaccination movement first emerged during armed protests in numerous state capitols against coronavirus lockdown measures. That cross-pollination expanded over time. On Jan. 6, while rioters advanced on the Capitol, numerous leading figures in the anti-vaccination movement were onstage nearby, holding their own rally to attack both the election results and Covid-19 vaccinations. ? Neil MacFarquhar  Fox News and its powerful owner, Rupert Murdoch, are facing a second major defamation suit over its coverage of the 2020 presidential election, a new front in the growing legal battle over media disinformation and its consequences. Dominion Voting Systems, an election technology company that was at the center of a baseless pro-Trump conspiracy about rigged voting machines, filed a lawsuit on Friday that accused Fox News of advancing lies that devastated its reputation and business. Dominion, which has requested a jury trial, is seeking at least $1.6 billion in damages. The lawsuit comes less than two months after Smartmatic, another election tech company, filed a $2.7 billion lawsuit against Mr. Murdoch¡¯s Fox Corporation and named several Fox anchors, including Maria Bartiromo and Lou Dobbs, as defendants. In a 139-page complaint filed in Delaware Superior Court, Dominion¡¯s legal team, led by the prominent defamation firm Clare Locke, portrayed Fox as an active player in spreading falsehoods that Dominion had altered vote counts and manipulated its machines to benefit Joseph R. Biden Jr. in the election. Those claims were false, but they were relentlessly pushed by President Donald J. Trump¡¯s lawyers, Rudolph Giuliani and Sidney Powell, in public forums, including appearances on Fox programs. In January, Dominion sued Mr. Giuliani and Ms. Powell for defamation.  The company also sued Mike Lindell, the chief executive of MyPillow and a Trump ally who was also a frequent guest on Fox programs, as well as shows on other conservative media outlets. Each of those suits seeks damages of more than $1 billion. ¡°The truth matters,¡± Dominion¡¯s lawyers wrote in Friday¡¯s complaint against Fox. ¡°Lies have consequences. Fox sold a false story of election fraud in order to serve its own commercial purposes, severely injuring Dominion in the process. If this case does not rise to the level of defamation by a broadcaster, then nothing does.¡± In a statement on Friday, Fox said that its 2020 election coverage ¡°stands in the highest tradition of American journalism¡± and pledged to ¡°vigorously defend against this baseless lawsuit in court.¡± Fox Corporation previously filed a motion to dismiss the Smartmatic lawsuit, arguing that the false claims of electoral fraud made on its channels were part of covering a fast-breaking story of significant public interest. ¡°An attempt by a sitting president to challenge the result of an election is objectively newsworthy,¡± Fox¡¯s legal team wrote in the motion. Dominion, which was founded in 2002, is one of the largest manufacturers of voting machine equipment in the United States, and its machines were used by election authorities in at least 28 states last year, including several states carried by Mr. Trump. ? Michael M. Grynbaum and Jonah E. Bromwich  As tensions between the United States and China escalate, a little-known federal agency is at the center of a debate in the Biden administration about how tough an approach to take when it comes to protecting American technology. The Bureau of Industry and Security, a division of the Commerce Department, wields significant power given its role in determining the types of technology that companies can export and that foreign businesses can have access to. In recent months, Washington lawmakers, lobbyists and other interested parties have been vying to influence how the agency, under the Biden administration, will approach a technology relationship with China that is crucial for both American industry and national security. China hawks, including national security experts, Republican lawmakers and progressive Democrats, say that American industry has held too much sway over the bureau. They have pressed the administration to select a leader for the agency who will more aggressively regulate the technology that the United States exports, according to people familiar with the discussions. Their opponents ? including some current and former Commerce Department employees, and many in industry and Washington think tanks ? caution that putting a hard-liner at the helm could backfire and harm national security by starving American industry of revenue it needs to stay on the cutting edge of research. ¡°It¡¯s a very complicated relationship between the economic and national security interest,¡± said Lindsay Gorman, a fellow for emerging technologies at the German Marshall Fund. ¡°The fine line the Commerce Department has to walk is protecting against national security risks that may not be top of mind for the industry in the short run, without killing the golden goose.¡± The Biden administration is still carrying out a review of its China policies and has not indicated how it plans to use the bureau¡¯s powers. Its engagement with China got off to an acrimonious start last week at a meeting in Anchorage, and President Biden, in his first news conference on Thursday, emphasized investing heavily in new technologies to compete with Beijing. ¡°The future lies in who can, in fact, own the future as it relates to technology, quantum computing, a whole range of things, including in medical fields,¡± Mr. Biden said. ? Ana Swanson  Gavin Schmidt, a leading climate scientist, was recently named to a newly created position as senior climate adviser to NASA. Now he faces the challenge of bringing NASA¡¯s climate science to the public and helping figure out how to apply it to saving the planet. Dr. Schmidt, who had headed NASA¡¯s Goddard Institute for Space Studies since 2014, will be working with an administration that is making climate policy one of its priorities. The Biden team is adding positions throughout the government for policymakers and experts like Dr. Schmidt who understand the threats facing the planet. ¡°Climate change is not only an environmental issue that belongs to the E.P.A., it¡¯s not only a science issue that belongs to NASA and NOAA,¡± said Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech University. ¡°Climate change is an everything issue,¡± she said, and ¡°it needs to be considered by every single federal agency.¡± Dr. Schmidt has written some 150 scientific papers, and has an active and sometimes acerbic social media presence. At the Goddard Institute, he led development of one of the most authoritative models of Earth¡¯s climate system. ¡°Climate change changes what you need to worry about,¡± he said, and the space agency can help the nation, and the world, figure out what we all need to know. That includes things like ¡°How do we accelerate the information that you need to build better defenses against coastal flooding?¡± and ¡°What do we really understand about intensifying precipitation?¡± In announcing Dr. Schmidt¡¯s appointment, the acting NASA administrator, Steve Jurczyk, said, ¡°This position will provide NASA leadership critical insights and recommendations for the agency¡¯s full spectrum of science, technology and infrastructure programs related to climate,¡± though the position will have no separate budget or staff. The space agency, which launches the satellites that monitor the conditions of the Earth¡¯s atmosphere, oceans, snow, ice and more, is one of the wellsprings of hard science that inform us all about climate change. But its leaders have sometimes had a difficult time talking about it. ¡°Not every administration was interested in calling it ¡®climate change,¡¯ the Trump administration most notably,¡± said Lori Garver, a former NASA deputy administrator who is now chief executive of Earthrise, a nonprofit that promotes using satellite data to address global warming. Ms. Garver said she was ¡°thrilled¡± by Dr. Schmidt¡¯s appointment, calling it a message that ¡°this will be a top priority for NASA.¡± ? John Schwartz  If there was ever any doubt of Mike Pompeo¡¯s political ambitions, the former secretary of state put them to rest on Friday by becoming the first big-name Republican to meet with voters in Iowa this year and lay the groundwork for a possible presidential campaign. Speaking near Des Moines in Urbandale, Iowa, Mr. Pompeo largely cast his remarks to the Westside Conservative Club as an effort to win a Republican majority in Congress in the 2022 midterm elections. But his breakfast speech was tinged with references to the presidential campaign in 2024 ? a race that Mr. Pompeo has never denied eyeing. ¡°These elections in 2022 will have a real impact on how 2024 ultimately goes as well, and it¡¯s why I¡¯m out here today,¡± Mr. Pompeo told the small crowd, according to Fox News. ¡°It¡¯s why I¡¯m going to continue to go out and campaign.¡± ¡°If we get 2022 right, 2024 will solve itself,¡± Mr. Pompeo said. The former top diplomat ? who also served as C.I.A. director to former President Donald J. Trump before becoming secretary of state in 2018 ? is also scheduled to speak to Republicans in New Hampshire on Monday on a video call to a fund-raiser for a state House candidate. Iowa and New Hampshire have been the first two states to cast votes in presidential campaigns in recent election cycles. Mr. Pompeo said he is also helping Republicans in Texas, Nebraska and Alabama. While at the State Department, Mr. Pompeo made little secret of his political aspirations. He was the first sitting secretary of state in modern history to address a party¡¯s national convention, a platform he used to introduce himself to a domestic audience while on a taxpayer-funded diplomatic visit to Jerusalem last August. He also hosted about two dozen dinners at the department, over a two-year period, for foreign policy discussions with American business leaders and political conservatives whose support would be crucial in future campaigns. In the two months since leaving office, Mr. Pompeo has repeatedly criticized the Biden administration¡¯s policies on a range of topics, including China, immigration and aid to Palestinians. (He has, however, steered clear of directly criticizing his successor, Antony J. Blinken, the current secretary of state.) Mr. Pompeo has also taken aim at social issues, like transgender athletes and the so-called cancel culture movement, to firmly establish his conservative bona fides. He has adopted Mr. Trump¡¯s mantra of ¡°America First¡± and on Friday told the breakfast crowd in Iowa that ¡°America will be the country that comes out in a way that delivers good outcomes for our people and for people all across the world ? and it¡¯ll be because of all the good work that we all do.¡± Curiously, in a Fox News interview earlier this week, Mr. Trump did not mention his former secretary of state while enumerating the Republicans he thinks are the future of the party. Asked by @LisaMarieBoothe which Republicans represent future of the party, Trump names Ron DeSantis, Josh Hawley, Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, Sarah Sanders and Kristi Noem. ? Lara Jakes  Congress is set to leave town for a two-week recess as one of the most tumultuous stints in Washington in recent memory comes to a close. After lawmakers faced a deadly attack by a mob of Trump supporters at the Capitol, they spent the following weeks impeaching and acquitting a president, confirming a slew of cabinet members and passing a sweeping $1.9 trillion pandemic relief bill, one of the largest injections of federal aid since the Great Depression. On the Senate floor on Thursday, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the majority leader, listed the policy areas he intended the chamber to focus on when lawmakers returned in April, including voting rights, infrastructure and gun safety. He also said the Senate would consider legislation to ¡°reform our broken immigration system.¡± ¡°When the Senate returns to session, our agenda will be no less ambitious than it was over the past few months,¡± Mr. Schumer said. At his first formal news conference on Thursday, President Biden said he would do ¡°everything in my power¡± to pass the voting rights legislation that Democrats were trying to advance through the Senate and calle",NYT

In Michigan, Democrats won full control of the Legislature for the first time since the 1980s. Credit...Emily Elconin for The New York Times Supported by By Mitch Smith Reporting from Chicago America¡¯s state capitals are as polarized as they have been in decades, with lawmakers imposing unflinchingly conservative or liberal agendas this year, even in politically diverse places. The 2022 election brought single-party control of the governor¡¯s office and legislature to 39 states, the most in at least three decades. Many of the 22 Republican-led states pushed new curbs on abortion, sweeping restrictions on gender transitions for youths and laws limiting discussion about sexuality in school classrooms. Democrats, who have full control in 17 states, passed new gun control measures, set limits on carbon emissions, and created safe havens for abortion and medical care for transgender people. The result was that the legislative season, which has ended in much of the country, left an even wider divide between Republican and Democratic states on the country¡¯s thorniest social issues. In some Republican states, lawmakers also took aim at the powers of Democratic officeholders or sought to limit local control in liberal-leaning cities. ¡°We¡¯ve always known that California was progressive, Texas was conservative, but it now feels like almost every state is kind of falling into one of those categories,¡± said Tim Storey, the chief executive of the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan group. Some of the states that pursued ambitious partisan agendas had long been single-party strongholds. In Washington, where Democrats have had full control of state government for 14 of the last 19 years, lawmakers banned the sale of AR-15-style weapons and enshrined protections for abortion and transgender medical care in law. In North Dakota, where Republicans have led the government since 1995, officials banned transition care for minors, outlawed abortion and barred materials deemed to be sexually explicit from the children¡¯s section of libraries. But even in states with recent histories as political battlegrounds, lawmakers pushed hard this year to the left or right, potentially leaving a significant segment of residents alienated. In Florida, which voted twice for Barack Obama but has since swung decisively toward Republicans, Gov. Ron DeSantis signed laws restricting abortion, banning transgender medical care for minors, loosening the requirements to impose the death penalty and allowing concealed guns to be carried without a permit. In Minnesota, where Democrats flipped a legislative chamber last year to narrowly take full control of the statehouse, Gov. Tim Walz signed bills codifying abortion rights, legalizing recreational marijuana and expanding voting rights for felons, a spree of liberal wins that drew the attention of Mr. Obama. ¡°If you need a reminder that elections have consequences,¡± the former president said on Twitter, ¡°check out what¡¯s happening in Minnesota.¡± Minnesota Republicans did not need reminding. In the course of just a few months, they had watched from the sidelines as their state became a laboratory of progressive policymaking, even though hundreds of thousands of Minnesotans vote Republican. ¡°The real travesty is, that¡¯s nearly 50 percent of the state that we represent,¡± said Mark Johnson, the Republican leader in the Minnesota Senate, ¡°and so it¡¯s constituents across the state that had little or no voice.¡± State Representative Tony McCombie, the House leader of the Republican minority in Illinois, where Democrats are in their fifth consecutive year of single-party control, said majority parties that lurch too far in one direction risk long-term political peril. ¡°States that do this on the right or the left ? it¡¯s going to blow up, the pendulum will swing the other way,¡± Ms. McCombie said. In Iowa, it was Republicans pressing the advantage conferred by their trifecta ? control of the governorship and both legislative chambers ? and continuing the transformation of their former swing state into a bastion of conservatism. Gov. Kim Reynolds signed bills passed by her fellow Republicans that loosened child labor rules and allowed families to put taxpayer money toward private-school tuition. Her state was also one of at least 16 this year that banned or significantly limited gender transition treatments for minors. ¡°Americans are taking notice as states around the country are looking to Iowa as a beacon for freedom and opportunity,¡± Ms. Reynolds said in a statement last month in which she called the legislative session ¡°historic.¡± On Thursday, Ms. Reynolds signed some of the last bills of the session into law, including a measure limiting the authority of the state auditor to access personal information and to take state agencies to court when performing investigations, drawing adamant objections from Democrats. The auditor, Rob Sand, happens to be the only Iowa Democrat still holding a statewide office. Mr. Sand framed the legislation as partisan overreach that could impede his ability to do his job. And he described a broader shift, in Iowa and nationally, away from listening to the minority party that ¡°shows us that the system that we¡¯re running right now doesn¡¯t work anymore.¡± A spokesman for the governor did not respond to an interview request. Republicans in several states wielded their power in ways that silenced or reduced the power of elected Democrats. In Mississippi, Republicans imposed a state-controlled police force and a second court system within the boundaries of Jackson, the largely Black and Democratic capital city. In Texas, Republicans passed a bill that would expand state oversight of elections in the county that includes Houston. In Tennessee, Republicans expelled two Democratic legislators who protested on the House floor. And in Montana, a Democratic lawmaker was barred from the House floor after speaking against a bill limiting transgender rights. Decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court last year added urgency, and often acrimony, to the lawmaking season. After the court said Americans have the right to carry guns outside their home, Democrats passed new laws this year seeking to limit access to firearms, while gun rights supporters filed lawsuits challenging restrictions and Republicans passed laws expanding gun access. On abortion, an issue the court returned to the states, Republicans moved to severely restrict or ban access in several states, including Florida, Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota, South Carolina and Wyoming, despite intraparty fights about how far to go. Democrats sought to strengthen abortion protections in many of their states. Democrats entered this year with full power in four new states ? Maryland and Massachusetts, where the governorship flipped, and Michigan and Minnesota, where legislative control shifted ? and more states under their control than at any point since 2009. After Republicans spent more than a decade consolidating state-level power and passing sweeping new laws, Democrats saw this session as an opportunity to reverse recent history, with slightly more Americans now living in states under their control than in those where Republicans are in charge. ¡°I¡¯ve been working my entire life to have an opportunity like this,¡± said Melissa Hortman, the speaker of the Minnesota House. ¡°I mean, it was a golden moment this year to have the trifecta and to have a surplus and to have bills and authors that were ready to go.¡± On a single day this session in Michigan, where Democrats won full control for the first time since the 1980s, lawmakers advanced bills to codify L.G.B.T.Q. rights, create a red-flag gun law and repeal a so-called right-to-work law loathed by labor unions.  ¡°There were a lot of things that we knew exactly what we wanted to do, and we knew what those policies looked like,¡± said Winnie Brinks, the majority leader in the Michigan Senate. But while she expressed no regrets about acting quickly, Ms. Brinks acknowledged that doing so ¡°was not exactly the most beneficial in terms of establishing really good working relationships¡± with Republicans. Across the country, some topics resonated repeatedly across partisan lines, including economic development and mental health. And with the economy relatively stable and some federal pandemic relief funds still unspent, many states had money available to create new programs, pass tax cuts or send checks to residents. California, with a projected budget deficit in the tens of billions of dollars, was a notable exception. Though the session was defined by the majority party scoring policy wins, there were moments when minority lawmakers made their presence known. In Oregon, the State Senate came to a standstill after Republicans fled the capitol, denying the majority Democrats a quorum and the ability to pass their agenda. And in Missouri and Nebraska, filibusters by Democrats ate up precious legislative time and helped to extract limited concessions from Republicans on bills restricting transgender rights. There were also moments of intraparty disagreement, including in New York, where some legislative Democrats deemed a judicial nominee put forth by the Democratic governor to be too conservative, and in Texas, where Republicans diverged on whether to impeach the state¡¯s Republican attorney general. In Colorado, a former swing state where Democrats have steadily built power in recent years, lawmakers raised the minimum age to buy a gun, required gender-neutral bathrooms in new public buildings and passed a first-of-its-kind law making it easier for farmers to repair their own equipment instead of relying on manufacturers. But Democrats diverged on a measure that would have banned certain high-powered guns, dooming that bill. ¡°We¡¯re not in a world where the Democrats all line up and vote the way the party is telling them to,¡± said Julie McCluskie, the Democratic speaker of the Colorado House of Representatives. As polarized as the nation¡¯s legislative season was this year, the next one has the potential to be even more lopsided. Though most states will not hold statewide elections again until 2024, a handful of races this November give Republicans an opening to claim up to three more trifectas. Democrats are defending governorships in Kentucky and Louisiana, both states that vote reliably Republican in presidential races. And Republicans need to flip only a few seats to win a Senate majority in Virginia, a state where Democrats lost control of the House and governor¡¯s mansion in recent years.

https://www.nytimes.com/article/tennessee-house-democrats-expulsion-shooting-gun-control.html?searchResultPosition=82,2023-05-20,Tennessee House Expulsions: What You Need to Know,"A week after Republicans ousted two Democratic lawmakers over a gun control protest, both returned to their seats. By Eliza Fawcett and Emily Cochrane In the wake of a school shooting in Nashville that left six people dead, three Democratic lawmakers took to the floor of the Republican-controlled Tennessee House chamber in late March to rally for stricter gun control. In a dramatic act of political retribution, Republicans moved to expel the three Democrats from the legislature, and on April 6 two of them, Representatives Justin Jones and Justin J. Pearson, were ousted in votes that passed largely along party lines. The third lawmaker, Representative Gloria Johnson, narrowly avoided expulsion by one vote. The extraordinary punitive action for an act of protest was just the third time since the Civil War era that the Tennessee House had expelled a lawmaker from its ranks. It sparked outrage among Democrats, including President Biden, who called the Republicans¡¯ moves ¡°shocking¡± and ¡°undemocratic.¡± With two House seats left vacant, the authority to name temporary replacements fell to the local governing bodies in the districts that had been represented by Mr. Jones and Mr. Pearson. Only four days after the expulsions, the Metropolitan Nashville Council unanimously voted to appoint Mr. Jones back to the seat in a pointed rebuke to the G.O.P., and he was sworn in the same day. The Shelby County Commission unanimously voted to send Mr. Pearson back, too, and he was sworn in on April 13. Here¡¯s what you need to know. Hundreds of students, parents and teachers have marched to the State Capitol since the Covenant School shooting on March 27 and have held demonstrations at the Capitol to demand action by the legislature to toughen gun laws. The Republicans who control state government, led by Gov. Bill Lee, have largely rejected the calls for tighter gun laws and have focused instead on toughening school security. Mr. Lee has signaled his openness to measures that would allow the authorities to confiscate guns from those who are deemed by a judge to be at risk of harming themselves or others. On March 30, Representatives Jones, Pearson and Johnson ? whose districts are in Nashville, Knoxville and Memphis, the state¡¯s three largest cities ? interrupted the legislature by chanting ¡°No action, no peace¡± on the House floor. Mr. Jones and Mr. Pearson, two of the youngest Black lawmakers in the chamber, had also used a bullhorn to engage with supporters in the galleries, and legislative proceedings were forced to a halt. The speaker of the House, Cameron Sexton, responded by comparing the three lawmakers to the rioters who breached the U.S. Capitol in 2021. He called their actions ¡°unacceptable¡± and a violation of House rules of decorum and procedure. By April 3, he had revoked their ID access to the State Capitol building and had stripped two of the three lawmakers of their committee assignments. Republicans then filed individual resolutions to formally expel each of the three Democrats. In each resolution, Republicans charged that the lawmaker ¡°did knowingly and intentionally bring disorder and dishonor¡± to the House and ¡°generally engaged in disorderly and disruptive conduct.¡± The measures did not cite any other consequence of the protests. On April 6, the House held separate votes on the three resolutions. Protesters again flooded the Capitol, and their chants of ¡°Gun control now¡± and ¡°Not one more¡± were deafening outside the House chamber. After hours of deeply personal, angry and at times condescending debate, the votes to expel Mr. Jones and Mr. Pearson passed largely along party lines, with the Republican supermajority voting overwhelmingly for expulsion. Ms. Johnson survived: The chamber voted 65 to 30 to remove her, falling one vote short. After the final vote, the crowds in the galleries burst into angry yells and cries of ¡°Shame on you¡± with fists held high. Seven Republicans had joined Democrats in voting against the expulsion of Ms. Johnson. Asked why she thought she had survived the expulsion vote, Ms. Johnson, who is white, said, ¡°It might have to do with the color of my skin.¡± Mr. Pearson, crowded by supporters after he was ejected and yelling over the sound of demonstrators, said: ¡°You cannot ignore the racial dynamic of what happened today ? two young Black lawmakers get expelled and the one white woman does not.¡± Republican leaders, speaking to reporters afterward, denied that race played a factor in the decision and pointedly noted that the majority of their conference was still in favor of expelling Ms. Johnson. Ms. Johnson, who represents parts of Knoxville, is the most senior of the three; she was first elected to the House for the 2013-2014 term. A former teacher, she was elected again in 2018. After redistricting following the 2020 census, she moved to avoid having to contest the seat of another Democratic member. Mr. Jones, 27, is one of the youngest members of the House. He won election in November to represent parts of Nashville. A graduate of Fisk University in Nashville, he made a name for himself locally as a community organizer. He has held sit-ins in the State Capitol and, in the summer of 2020, led a 61-day protest against racial injustice outside the building that included demands for the removal of a bust of a Confederate general. Mr. Pearson, 28, won a special election by a landslide in January to represent parts of Memphis. A native of the city and graduate of Bowdoin College in Maine, he is the son of an educator and a preacher. Mr. Pearson gained prominence when he successfully opposed a crude oil pipeline proposed for South Memphis. In interviews, all three lawmakers spoke of how gun violence ? and in some instances, their personal experiences of it ? had helped shape their paths to politics. Mr. Pearson recounted the pain of losing family members and a mentor to gun violence, and said the push for tighter restrictions on firearms ¡°is personal when you lose your friends, when you lose loved ones.¡± Mr. Jones recalled attending his first protests after Trayvon Martin, a 17-year-old Black teenager, was shot by a neighborhood watch volunteer in Florida. ¡°This issue is something that has been a part of our generation,¡± he said. ¡°This is a very personal issue.¡± Ms. Johnson recalled a shooting at Central High School in Knoxville that took place while she was still working as a teacher, and ¡°the terror on the kids¡¯ faces as they were running down that hill into my classroom.¡± Ultimately, special elections will be held to fill the seats of the expelled lawmakers. Mr. Jones and Mr. Pearson are able to run again in the elections, and both have said they will. For the period before the special elections, the local governing bodies in each district have the power to appoint temporary representatives. On April 10, four days after the expulsions, the Metropolitan Council, which oversees Nashville and the surrounding county, voted unanimously to send Mr. Jones back to his seat. He was quickly sworn in on the steps of the State Capitol, without ever missing a full floor session. Two days later, the Shelby County Commission unanimously voted to appoint Mr. Pearson back. He returned to his seat on April 13. Sheelagh McNeill contributed research. Eliza Fawcett is a reporter for the National desk and a member of the 2022-2023 New York Times fellowship class.

A memorial for the victims of the shooting at Robb Elementary School still stands at a plaza in Uvalde, Texas. A year later, some residents have begun to ask how long it will be there.Credit...Tamir Kalifa for The New York Times Supported by By Edgar Sandoval and J. David Goodman Photographs by Tamir Kalifa Reporting from Uvalde, Texas At a school board meeting this month in Uvalde, Texas, parents and administrators found themselves locked in what had become a familiar argument: Nearly a year had passed since a gunman breached Robb Elementary School and killed 19 children and two teachers. The community was still waiting for officials to fully disclose how it happened. For more audio journalism and storytelling, download New York Times Audio, a new iOS app available for news subscribers. ¡°Almost a year now, and honestly nothing has changed,¡± Jesse Rizo, the uncle of one of the massacre victims, told the board. ¡°These people are pretty much begging you guys to answer questions. You came here and you pretty much oppress people. They ask you questions, you don¡¯t have answers.¡± Despite the passage of time, there is still strong disagreement over who should be fired for the slow police response to one of the worst school shootings in American history, and what position the town should take on the repeated calls from families of the victims to restrict guns. Neighbors who have known each other for years now find themselves unable to agree and more distant than ever before. ¡°We used to be a close community,¡± Mr. Rizo said after the school board meeting on May 15. ¡°Now it¡¯s like we don¡¯t know each other anymore.¡± United in grief in the weeks after the shooting that ignited a national firestorm over how the police respond to mass shootings, Uvalde in the painful months since then has drifted apart, dividing along fault lines that barely existed a year ago. The fissures run deep and remain raw: between the victims¡¯ relatives lobbying for stricter gun laws, and neighbors who have long been avid hunters and gun owners and bristle at any new restrictions; between supporters of the police, who are the subject of a district attorney¡¯s investigation for their delay in taking down the gunman, and residents who now distrust law enforcement; between those still in mourning and those who would like to move on. Frictions have occasionally spilled into the open in a city where everyone still shops at the same grocery stores, eats at the same restaurants, attends the same Little League games. At a recent library event, residents pulled the city manager aside to ask, quietly, about when Uvalde could begin to put the shooting behind them, starting with finally getting rid of a makeshift shrine to the massacre¡¯s victims that still fills the central plaza. ¡°I¡¯ve had more than one person ask me: When are you going to clean up the plaza?¡± said the city manager, Vince DiPiazza. There have been overt displays of anger. The relatives of one of the children killed screamed at the mother of the 18-year-old gunman after running into her by chance on the street last year. A local pastor drew ire for defending the police during a school board meeting last summer. One person urged him to sit down, shouting, ¡°Your time is up!¡± ¡°The negativity divides. You have everybody getting mad,¡± said Berlinda Arreola, the step-grandmother of one of the victims. Disagreements and lingering resentments have complicated the preparations for Wednesday¡¯s commemoration of the massacre. Officials urged outsiders to stay away from Uvalde, while relatives of some residents planned a memorial march through town. Rifts have grown even among the families. Joe Alejandro, whose niece was killed, found himself disagreeing with other relatives who have been demanding stricter gun laws, such as raising the age from 18 to 21 to buy an AR-15-style rifle, the type used in last year¡¯s massacre. ¡°I¡¯ve had guns all of my life, and my gun is not going to kill anybody,¡± Mr. Alejandro said. ¡°This is how we grew up. You go hunting in the morning and go to school and the guns stay there,¡± he said, referring to his car. ¡°Why come after me?¡± Mr. Alejandro¡¯s view is a common one in Uvalde, where voters in the majority Hispanic city surrounded by ranches and hunting land voted for Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, a little over?five months after the shooting, in a race where his opponent, Beto O¡¯Rourke, frequently wore a Uvalde baseball hat and had promised stronger gun control. After more than 100 students walked out of classes last month as part of protests against gun violence, school administrators warned them that they would face consequences the next time. Long after the gunfire, Uvalde remains on edge. Recently, the City Hall and a large supermarket went into lockdown after residents circulated images of a man walking around downtown with a gun on his shoulder. (It turned out to be a BB gun.) Some parents kept their children home from school during the final full week of classes this month amid social media threats of violence that turned out to be unfounded. Tensions remain in part because several investigations into the shooting and police response remain unresolved. An inquiry by the district attorney, Christina Mitchell, remains open into whether charges should be brought against any of the dozens of officers who waited for more than an hour to storm the classroom where the gunman was holed up with students and kill him. Ms. Mitchell has said?that?she intends to present any evidence of criminal wrongdoing to a grand jury. But such a presentation is likely still many months away. ¡°A case of this magnitude has to be deliberate, has to be thorough, and there cannot be haste,¡± she said in a statement. ¡°Because I have seen cases that are quickly investigated and justice does not prevail in those cases.¡± A medical study to determine whether a faster confrontation with the gunman could have saved any of the children has yet to be completed. The Justice Department, too, is still working on its inquiry into the police response. Vanita Gupta, the department¡¯s third highest-ranking official, visited Uvalde last month to meet with officials and families and reassure them that the investigation was still happening, even if its results were not yet forthcoming. The department has helped city officials connect with people in other cities torn apart by mass shootings, sharing a kind of grim new playbook for navigating the long, painful aftermath. ¡°It reinforced in my mind that what was happening here is not unusual,¡± said Mr. DiPiazza. Much of the frustration has been directed at school administrators, who oversee the school district¡¯s small police force. The chief of that force, Pete Arredondo, was immediately singled out by the Texas Department of Public Safety¡¯s director, Steve McCraw, for failing to swiftly confront the gunman. But a report by a Texas House committee later found ¡°systemic failures¡± in the police response, not just by Mr. Arredondo, but by other agencies, including the state D.P.S. and the city Police Department, which also participated in the response. Both Mr. Arredondo and a state police sergeant on scene, Juan Maldonado, were fired, and the officer who had been acting as the chief of the city Police Department at the time of the massacre resigned. The school district revamped its Police Department, but the hiring of a new school police chief has not eased tensions. When a father of two students questioned the qualifications of a new police hire during a recent school board meeting, the district responded by barring him from school property for two years. A letter signed by the new interim school superintendent, Gary Patterson, called the father¡¯s actions disruptive and disturbing. In addition to the school police chief, the district has hired three additional officers and hopes to bring in several more. ¡°We¡¯re being very careful and trying to hire the right type of person,¡± Mr. Patterson said in an interview. ¡°Our Police Department is the most scrutinized in the world right now.¡± The school building where the shooting took place now sits behind chain-link fencing, its windows boarded over, ready for a planned demolition. The sign at one corner of the campus has become a kind of shrine, visited by victims¡¯ relatives and passing motorists, and students have been dispersed to other schools until a new facility can be built. Before the shooting, the most prominent mural downtown had been the one bearing the town name, images from its history and its previous claim to Texas fame as ¡°the honey capital of the world.¡± Now several streets and alleys are emblazoned with towering images of the fourth graders and their teachers who were killed, an unavoidable reminder of the city¡¯s forever altered identity. From the first hours after the shooting, it was clear that the massacre would test the closeness of the community. On the night of May 24, victims¡¯ relatives had gathered at a hospital awaiting news of their children when the gunman¡¯s mother walked in. Her mother ? the gunman¡¯s grandmother ? had been the first victim, shot in the face before the gunman drove to the school. She has since recovered. Ms. Arreola, the step-grandmother of Amerie Jo Garza, who was killed, recalled feeling stunned as the gunman¡¯s mother introduced herself. ¡°I just wanted to let you know that it was my son who killed your kids, and I¡¯m so sorry for this,¡± Ms. Arreola remembered her saying. When Ms. Arreola and other relatives saw the woman on the street two months later, in July, Ms. Arreola became enraged. ¡°What reason did he have?¡± she yelled, in a scene captured by a camera crew for the Spanish-language broadcaster Telemundo. The gunman¡¯s mother could be seen calling 911 asking for help, and also addressing the relatives. ¡°I know my son was a coward, you don¡¯t think I don¡¯t know that?¡± she said. ¡°You don¡¯t think I¡¯m carrying all that with me? I know. And I¡¯m sorry.¡± On a recent evening, scores of parents gathered to watch Little League games as the sun went down over a city park. Clouds slid by overhead, delivering a light drizzle. ¡°Life goes on,¡± said Lupe Leija, who works in construction and also serves on the league¡¯s board. ¡°But there¡¯s still anger.¡± He said his son was at Robb Elementary during the shooting and refused to sleep alone for two months after. Now, he said, his son and others were coming to the games, just trying to regain a sense of normality. ¡°A lot of people come here to relax,¡± he said. ¡°People just want to feel comfort.

https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/06/us/backpack-ban-flint-schools.html?searchResultPosition=84,2023-05-06,Michigan School District Bans Backpacks Over Safety Concerns,"Officials in Flint were alarmed by threats to students¡¯ safety. The ban is in effect at least until the end of the school year. By Lauren McCarthy On the back of a door in a home in Flint, Mich., there hangs a black Trailmaker backpack that belongs to Jaxon Williams, a third grader at Freeman Elementary. It hasn¡¯t been moved for nearly a week. ¡°It¡¯s officially retired, like a jersey,¡± said his mother, Ladel Lewis, a City Council member. That¡¯s because Jaxon and over 2,800 other students across 11 campuses in the Flint Community Schools are subject to a ban on backpacks that began this week after district officials were alarmed by threats to students¡¯ safety. It will remain in effect at least until the end of the school year in mid-June. After the first week under the ban, Dr. Lewis and other parents in the district expressed frustration and skepticism, saying that determined students would carry weapons under their clothing. Some experts also question the effectiveness of such bans. The ban, which allows bags the size of small purses, came less than two weeks after a security threat led to the closing of a high school in the district for two days. At a special meeting of the Flint Board of Education, educators voiced their growing concerns about school safety after a series of school shootings around the country, including one in Oxford, Mich., a community about 30 miles outside Flint, where a student shot and killed four classmates at a high school in 2021. Younger children have also been bringing weapons to school. In January, a 6-year-old first grader in Newport News, Va., shot his teacher with a handgun. ¡°In my 15 years of service here in Flint Community Schools, I¡¯ve never felt the way I do now,¡± Ernest Steward, the district¡¯s director of student services, said at the meeting. Mr. Steward¡¯s safety concerns are valid, said Justin Heinze, an educational psychologist at the University of Michigan¡¯s School of Public Health who focuses on school violence prevention. ¡°It¡¯s pretty much undeniable that the number of shootings and the severity of shootings are going up¡± in schools, Dr. Heinze said. A 2022 report from the National Center for Education Statistics and the Bureau of Justice Statistics recorded a total of 93 school shootings during the 2020-21 school year, the highest since 2000-01. About 3 percent of students in kindergarten through 12th grade will bring a weapon to school in a given year, Dr. Heinze said. At the April 25 board meeting, Mr. Steward recommended eliminating backpacks for at least the rest of the academic year. The threat to the high school was ¡°just one incident of ongoing issues we¡¯ve had this year around students bringing weapons into our buildings in backpacks,¡± he said. He added that the district had banned backpacks in the past. As surging gun violence continues to devastate American classrooms and the president himself declared that he was powerless to prevent it, a patchwork of simple measures, including policies requiring clear backpacks or banning them altogether, have taken on heightened significance. Backpack bans have been rolled out in other communities recently, including one put in place this week at an elementary school in Ocala, Fla., after a student brought in a toy gun that looked real, a spokesman for the district said. In an April 27 letter announcing the new policy, Kevelin Jones, the superintendent in Flint, wrote that ¡°backpacks make it easier for students to hide weapons, which can be disassembled and harder to identify or hidden¡± but that ¡°clear backpacks do not completely fix this issue.¡± ¡°By banning backpacks altogether and adding an increased security presence across the district, we can better control what is being brought into our buildings,¡± he wrote. Dr. Heinze said there was not much evidence to support either banning backpacks or mandating clear ones, noting that only a handful of studies in the past 20 years had looked at the issue in depth.  Dr. Lewis questioned why the ban was necessary for elementary school students. She said she had stopped sending Jaxon to school with a notebook, a folder and a change of clothes for his after-school activities. Chloe Combs, an eighth grader at Holmes STEM Academy in Flint, has been bringing her lunch to school every day since kindergarten, said her mother, Sherese Combs. On Monday, Chloe, 14, switched from a backpack with plenty of room for a lunch bag and a water bottle to a miniature backpack, the size of a small purse, that can only fit a smaller lunch container. She¡¯s not able to bring quite as much food, Ms. Combs said, ¡°but she manages.¡± Ms. Combs stressed that parents should do more to ensure that their children were not bringing weapons to school. She expressed disappointment over a violent clash between two parents during student pickup at a nearby charter school, in which the state police said one woman had shot another. ¡°The only time I¡¯m comfortable is when she gets home from school,¡± Ms. Combs said about Chloe. ¡°It¡¯s just very stressful.¡± Lauren McCarthy, a planning editor for live coverage at The Times, is on temporary assignment as a breaking-news reporter.

https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/22/us/politics/kamala-harris-gun-control.html?searchResultPosition=85,2019-04-22,Kamala Harris Proposes Executive Orders on Gun Control,"By Astead W. Herndon Senator Kamala Harris of California, the former prosecutor who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination, on Monday committed to a host of executive actions to implement gun control measures that have long failed to pass in Congress. At a town hall hosted by CNN, Ms. Harris said that, if elected, she would sign an executive order mandating background checks for customers of any firearms dealer who sells more than five guns a year. The executive actions would also include more stringent regulation of gun manufacturers that could result in revoked licenses or prosecution, as well as an attempt to close the loophole that allows some domestic abusers to purchase guns if their victim is an unwedded partner. [Five Democrats took questions from college students on CNN. Here are the highlights.] ¡°There are people in Washington, D.C., supposed leaders,¡± Ms. Harris said on CNN Monday evening, ¡°who have failed to have the courage to reject a false choice which suggests you¡¯re either in favor of the second amendment or you want to take everyone¡¯s guns away.¡± ¡°We need reasonable gun safety laws in this country, starting with universal background checks and a renewal of the assault weapon ban,¡± she added, ¡°but they have failed to have the courage to act.¡± She said she would introduce the executive actions if Congress did not pass gun control legislation in the first 100 days of her presidency. The announcement marks the second policy proposal of Ms. Harris¡¯s presidential run; the first was a federal increase in teacher pay. The two policies dovetail with Ms. Harris¡¯s political wager, which combines her historic status as one of the most viable black women to run for president with a patchwork of incrementally progressive proposals. In the past year, gun control has re-emerged as a top priority for Democrats, particularly after the youth-led March for Our Lives brought thousands of motivated high schoolers to Washington last year. Even as the issue has gained traction in statehouses, however, Congress has failed to enact any major gun control legislation, and Ms. Harris¡¯s executive action would be undoubtedly controversial and would quite likely face legal challenges. After the shooting of elementary school students in Newtown, Conn., former President Barack Obama made gun control a top priority, exerting significant political capital in a failed attempt to pass universal background checks for gun purchasers. As a California prosecutor, Ms. Harris supported such legislation, while also calling for bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, prohibiting those convicted of a federal hate crime from purchasing guns, and making gun trafficking a federal crime.

By Matt Stevens Representative Eric Swalwell of California has made gun control the signature issue of his campaign. Mr. Swalwell this month released an eight-part plan to end gun violence.  Several candidates have called for a ban on assault weapons, but Mr. Swalwell¡¯s plan goes further. He calls for a mandatory nationwide buyback program for assault weapons and suggests that the government criminally prosecute anyone who refuses to comply. Like other proposals, Mr. Swalwell¡¯s plan also seeks to close loopholes that allow domestic abusers to possess guns; implement more widespread background checks on gun buyers; create a federal licensing program for gun owners; and allow people to sue gun manufacturers.  His plan calls for additional investment in education, after-school programs and other community-level initiatives aimed at assisting the neighborhoods most affected by gun violence. Mr. Swalwell has sought to stand out in the crowded Democratic field by making gun control his top policy priority.  His first major event as a candidate was a town hall near Parkland, Fla. In recent weeks, he has conducted a national listening tour on gun violence. Gun control policy has long been considered something of a land mine for the left. Repeated attempts over the years to enact federal universal background checks for new gun purchases have failed.  The current field of Democratic candidates have engaged with the issue more readily than past candidates, which could make it harder for Mr. Swalwell to distinguish himself.

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/23/us/biden-gun-control.html?searchResultPosition=87,2021-03-23,"Biden has a long, frustrating history of pushing for gun control.","The president is in a position distressingly similar to the one he confronted about eight years ago as vice president: trying to figure out a way to stop mass shootings, and meeting staunch resistance. By Glenn Thrush As president, Joseph R. Biden Jr. finds himself in a position distressingly similar to the one he confronted eight years ago as vice president: trying to figure out a way to stop mass shootings and meeting resistance from conservative gun owners and their political allies. In 2020, gun control was given a prominent place on Mr. Biden¡¯s campaign website, but it had been a back-burner concern for a new administration single-mindedly determined to address the pandemic and its economic damage. That could change following the attacks in Atlanta and Boulder, and if so, Mr. Biden¡¯s successes and failures over the past three decades on gun control are likely to inform how he confronts the crisis as president. President Barack Obama chose not to act immediately following the massacre of 26 children and adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. in 2012, as many Democrats had hoped, by pushing for a quick vote on gun control legislation. Instead, he delegated the task of coming up with a package of reforms to Mr. Biden, who had helped pass the landmark Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act and a 10-year assault weapons ban in the 1990s when he served in the Senate. From his earliest days in the administration. Mr. Biden pushed Mr. Obama to do more on guns, to little avail, his advisers later said. ¡°Even before Newtown, the vice president had wanted the administration to push harder on the issue,¡± Bruce Reed, Mr. Biden¡¯s chief of staff as vice president, and still a trusted adviser, told a reporter in 2015. The decision to tap Mr. Biden irked many of Mr. Obama¡¯s closest advisers: They thought he needed to personally push through a series of strong measures immediately, while emotions were high, to force lawmakers to cast votes of conscience. Five weeks after the killings, Mr. Obama and Mr. Biden announced 23 relatively modest executive actions, and called on Congress to pass three laws: universal background checks, a new assault weapons ban, and a prohibition on high-capacity gun clips. Mr. Biden, consulting with his former colleagues in the Senate, decided the best course of action was to focus on only one element, the background checks, and persuaded progressives to settle for a limited but important initiative. The strategy, and the bill, quickly failed. ¡°Eight years later, there have been plenty of thoughts and prayers, but we know that is not enough,¡± Mr. Biden said in December, marking the anniversary of Sandy Hook. ¡°We will fight to end this scourge on our society and enact common sense reforms that are supported by a majority of Americans and that will save countless lives.¡± Mr. Biden¡¯s proposals, listed on his website, are strikingly similar to the reforms he proposed as vice president. White House aides are considering a number of executive actions, including one that would impose background checks for buyers of homemade firearms that lack serial numbers, a proposal to close a loophole that allows a gun to be transferred from licensed gun dealers before a completed background check, and various plans to keep guns away from people suffering from mental illness.

In one city, a support group that includes people who spent time in the same trauma ward offers a way to cope. By Neelam Bohra ROCHESTER, N.Y. ? Three years after a former boyfriend kicked down her door, fired a gun at her nine times and left her paralyzed, Porche Powell steeled herself for a virtual visit to the hospital ward where she had spent long weeks in recovery. Joining a video call, she saw a man lying in the same bed in the same room where she had been told that she would never walk again. His tearful description of being gunned down on a Rochester street jolted her back to her own struggles in Room 5-1200 ? the physical medicine and rehabilitation unit that its occupants refer to as ¡°the 512.¡± When she left that unit, at Strong Memorial Hospital, a month after the shooting, Ms. Powell, 28, spent days sitting in empty rooms in her home with nothing to do. For almost a year, she couldn¡¯t talk about her new life without crying, until a nurse connected her with a recently formed support group for gun violence survivors and others with spinal cord injuries. The man in the hospital bed on the video call, Rickey Forcer Jr., would be its newest member. And, as Ms. Powell and other members welcomed him over the summer, they didn¡¯t hold back. ¡°It¡¯s going to get worse when you first get home and have to adjust, before it gets better,¡± she told him, relating her own experience. Though the death toll from mass shootings and gun violence across the United States tends to grab the most attention, in recent years those events have left a far greater number of people struggling with physical injuries, including lifelong paralysis. Government agencies, including the Justice Department and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, do not track the number of Americans disabled by gun violence, and various sources provide divergent numbers when trying to identify the number of injured survivors. A 2020 study from public health researchers at the University of Pennsylvania and Columbia University estimated that there are more than 300 firearms injuries on average in America every day, leaving twice as many survivors as fatalities. Although the severity of those injuries can vary greatly, advocates and medical professionals say the number of survivors with long-term disabilities is large and growing, in the thousands every year. ¡°We measure death, but we don¡¯t always measure those who can¡¯t be recorded,¡± said Emily Miller, a spokeswoman for the gun control advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety. Over the past decade, as the number of disabled survivors has grown, so have support networks like the one run by the Rochester Spinal Association, allowing victims and their families to lean on a community that understands the grief and pain of a life altered in a hail of gunfire. ¡°It feels like a forgotten sector of people,¡± said DeAndra Yates-Dycus, a mother from Indianapolis who started a support group and resource network after her son had been shot and paralyzed by a stray bullet during a children¡¯s birthday party. In Chicago, which has one of the highest rates of concentrated gun violence in the country, a chapter of Healing Hurt People assists a range of disabled survivors, including those who use wheelchairs and those with colostomy bags. ¡°Society does not value their lives in the ways that they should,¡± said Andy Wheeler, one of the group¡¯s coordinators, ¡°and it¡¯s horrible.¡± Part of the reason they are often overlooked, Mr. Wheeler said, is that so many disabled survivors are young Black men ? a group that society, and its support systems, often neglects. Shooting injury rates are highest among Black Americans, according to Everytown. ¡°A lot of Black men accept they¡¯ll be shot at some point, and they¡¯ll either die or survive it,¡± said Mike Patterson, one of the Rochester group¡¯s unofficial founders, who was shot 21 years ago in Philadelphia and uses a wheelchair. ¡°No one realizes there¡¯s this third option ? paralyzation ? that can change your life forever.¡± The rising tide of gun violence in Rochester, a city with an industrial past and newly swelling population, led Mayor Malik Evans to declare a state of emergency in July after a string of shootings, including the one that disabled Mr. Forcer. It has also continued to bring people to the attention of ¡°the 512¡± survivors who are among the core of the new support group. Since the fall, the Rochester network has begun accepting members from other states through the efforts of Chris Hilderbrant, the director of the Rochester Spinal Association, who has raised awareness of the group via social media and word of mouth. For Ms. Powell, a certified nursing assistant for 12 years until she was shot, the group has given her a new way to care for others ? and herself. ¡°I realized sitting in a room, depressed all day, was not going to change my situation,¡± she said. ¡°It wasn¡¯t going to make me magically walk. I might as well just live life, see what I can do, find a new normal.¡± Now, she has become one of the group¡¯s leaders, offering insights and advice, as she did after Mr. Forcer introduced himself on the video call, describing through tears how he had survived a torn lung, three broken ribs and a severed spine after being shot during a dispute over selling marijuana. ¡°I¡¯ve lived a whole 30 years being able to walk and run, play basketball with my son, box, drive every day,¡± Mr. Forcer said, ¡°and now I¡¯ve got to learn all that over again?¡± He talked about how he had felt as he was lying on the ground, bleeding from the mouth and gasping for breath. ¡°That¡¯s how I was, too,¡± Ms. Powell responded. ¡°The bullet had punctured my lungs, and I just couldn¡¯t breathe.¡± Just a few weeks later, Ms. Powell and many other group members gathered in a park on Lake Ontario for a rare treat: meeting in person. They spread sandwiches and homemade brownies across picnic tables as their children and spouses joined them, enjoying a local band playing classic rock on the other side of the park. Ms. Powell¡¯s 13-year-old daughter was there, chattering with a friend. Ms. Powell recalled how her daughter had been by her side throughout the journey, even for the parts she had not wanted her to witness. That was part of what gave her motivation to become more active with the support group, she said. ¡°I was crying plenty days and plenty nights. I woke up every morning wishing that I could walk,¡± she said in that first meeting with Mr. Forcer. ¡°But I try now. I¡¯m able to do stuff for my kids. I cook for my kids. I clean. You could do anything a person walking can do. We just got to figure out a way to do it.¡± As night fell on the picnic, the group went down to the beach, using a mat recently rolled out over the sand for wheelchair users, which led all the way to the water. It felt good, Ms. Powell said, to be together. ¡°The group,¡± she declared, ¡°has been my therapy.¡± Neelam Bohra is the 2022-2023 disability reporting fellow for the National desk.

By Clay Risen Mark Glaze, who was widely considered a founding figure in the modern gun-control movement, died on Oct. 31 in Scranton, Pa. He was 51. Erika Soto Lamb, a friend and former colleague at the organization Everytown for Gun Safety, where Mr. Glaze was a former executive director, said his death was a suicide. Mr. Glaze had been in the Lackawanna County Prison since being arrested on a charge of driving under the influence in September. Mr. Glaze was already a veteran political organizer in January 2011 when he joined Mayors Against Illegal Guns, an organization that was founded by Michael R. Bloomberg and more than a dozen other mayors. He worked for the organization part time, as a consultant on loan from the Raben Group, a public affairs firm. Gun violence was at the time one of those issues that Washington insiders compared to the weather: something everyone talked about but no one did anything to change. The National Rifle Association controlled the topic, cajoling even moderate Democrats to oppose any effort to regulate firearms. A decade later, gun violence is a winning issue for many state and local governments, the N.R.A. is in tatters and Congress is increasingly willing to stand up for gun safety ? a drastic shift that many attribute to Mr. Glaze¡¯s tireless organizing and brilliant strategizing. ¡°Mark unquestionably was one of the architects of the gun safety movement,¡± John Feinblatt, the president of Everytown for Gun Safety, said in a phone interview. The changes happened over several years amid a series of high-profile mass shootings. It started a few days after Mr. Glaze joined the organization, when a gunman shot 19 people in a parking lot in Tucson, Ariz., killing six and injuring 13, including Representative Gabby Giffords. Then, on Dec. 14, 2012, a gunman killed 26 people, mostly children, at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. Newtown was a tragedy, but as Mr. Glaze immediately recognized, it was also an opportunity for action. So did the White House: President Barack Obama promised to put ¡°everything I¡¯ve got¡± into passing substantial gun-control legislation. Working off a blueprint provided by Mr. Glaze, the White House called for a renewed ban on assault weapons, expanded background checks and other measures. But over the next few months, despite widespread public support, the bill was whittled down by senators from both parties who faced unrelenting pressure from the N.R.A. By April, even a watered-down measure to improve background checks failed to clear the 60-vote threshold needed to beat a filibuster. It was a stinging defeat for Mr. Obama and the gun control movement, but Mr. Glaze saw a silver lining. He understood what had to be done: He had to beat the N.R.A. at its own game. Rather than focus on Washington and wait for a mass shooting to spur interest in gun control, he would build from the grass roots and create a permanent pressure campaign on politicians at every level, from the White House to city halls. ¡°They for a generation have had this field to themselves,¡± he said of the N.R.A. in a 2013 interview with The Wall Street Journal. ¡°There has really been nothing on the other side in terms of grass-roots strength, intensity on most days or support on Election Day.¡± He resigned from the Raben Group to work full time for Mayors Against Illegal Guns. He hired dozens of staff members and more than doubled the number of mayors endorsing the organization. He rallied local activists and put pressure on purple- and red-state Democrats, who are often the most responsive to N.R.A. pressure. And he made himself a face of the movement, going on television talk shows and speaking to any reporter who would listen. ¡°Mark was somebody who could both sit with victims and survivors of gun violence while also operating at the political level and working with legislators to change the politics of the issue,¡± said Peter Ambler, the executive director of Giffords, an anti-gun-violence group created by Ms. Giffords. Mr. Glaze, who was gay, took particular inspiration from the movement for same-sex marriage, which had for decades pushed for changes at the state and local level before taking on Congress and the Supreme Court. ¡°We felt keenly that there are some issues where Congress was the curtain-raiser, and some where it¡¯s a finale,¡± Mr. Feinblatt said. Mr. Glaze drew equally from the history of Mothers Against Drunk Driving, which had rallied women activists to push for tougher drinking-and-driving laws. He sought allies among the increasing number of mothers who were leading a similar charge on guns. In 2014, Mayors Against Illegal Guns merged with Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America to form Everytown for Gun Safety. Both organizations had received significant financial support from Mr. Bloomberg. Mr. Glaze stepped down from Everytown a few months later to open his own consulting firm, but he continued to dedicate much of his time to gun safety. He helped found the group Guns Down, and he consulted for Giffords and the organization Brady: United Against Gun Violence. ¡°He was very big on not letting things slide with elected officials or big businesses that profit off guns,¡± Alexis Confer, the executive director of March for Our Lives, an anti-gun violence group, said in a phone interview. By the time of the mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Fla., in February 2018, in which a gunman killed 17 people and injured 17 others, the landscape had fundamentally shifted. The issue moved into the streets, with protests and boycotts of companies that dealt with the N.R.A., as well as civil lawsuits that left the gun lobby reeling. Although Mr. Glaze never claimed credit, other activists said that shift would not have happened without him. ¡°Those successes would not have been possible without leaders like Mark who worked to correct the failure of the movement in the wake of the Newtown votes,¡± Igor Volsky, the executive director of Guns Down, said in a phone interview. Mark Charles Glaze was born on Oct. 21, 1970, in Pueblo, Colo. His father, Charles Glaze, owned a gun store and belonged to the N.R.A.; his mother, Nancy Green, was a homemaker. ¡°If you had told me when I was growing up in the mountains of Colorado, shooting guns on the weekend with a dad who is an N.R.A. member and a gun dealer, that The Wall Street Journal would call me the face of the gun control movement, I¡¯m not sure I would have believed you,¡± Mr. Glaze said in a video he made for Colorado College, his alma mater. Mr. Glaze graduated from Colorado College in 1992 with a degree in political economy and received a law degree from the George Washington University in 1999. After law school, he worked for a number of campaign-finance reform organizations before joining the Raben Group. He is survived by his son, Archer. Mr. Glaze had long struggled with addiction and depression. His arrest came after he fled the scene of a car accident. Gun control might have been his legacy and his passion, but Mr. Glaze said it was something he had just ¡°stumbled into¡± amid his work on issues like teacher unions, gay rights and international human rights. ¡°The work I like to do,¡± he said in the Colorado College video, ¡°involves big-issue campaigns where you¡¯re trying to change public policy for the better, and those campaigns involve lots of moving parts.¡± If you are having thoughts of suicide, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 (TALK).

By Reid J. Epstein The gun control organization backed by Michael R. Bloomberg will soon begin a national advertising campaign aimed at pressuring Republican senators to support measures that would strengthen and expand background checks for gun buyers. The campaign by the group, Everytown for Gun Safety, comes after two mass shootings in less than a week killed eight people at spas in Georgia and 10 at a supermarket in Boulder, Colo. The organization¡¯s political arm plans to kick off the campaign in April with $1 million to $1.5 million in television and digital advertisements. John Feinblatt, Everytown¡¯s president, said the ads would target Republican senators including Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania and Susan Collins of Maine, who backed the failed 2013 effort to expand background checks, along with ¡°a number of retiring senators¡± who have opposed new gun control measures in the past. Mr. Feinblatt said the campaign was aimed at securing the 60 votes needed for the Senate to pass gun control proposals that have already passed the House, which include expanding federal background checks for new gun purchases. It will not ask Democratic senators to alter the filibuster rules to pass any measure with a simple majority vote. ¡°Every senator needs to know how urgent this matter is, and every senator needs to know we mean business about seizing the moment and getting the bills passed,¡± Mr. Feinblatt said on Wednesday. ¡°This is about getting 60 votes, which we think is entirely possible because the political calculus has changed.¡± Everytown has become the biggest player in gun control politics in recent years. The organization spent about $55 million backing Democratic candidates in 2020. Mr. Feinblatt said the campaign would continue until the Senate sent the measures to President Biden, who called on Tuesday not only for background checks but also for an assault weapons ban. Such a ban has not received a serious debate in Congress, and Mr. Bloomberg¡¯s organization is not pushing it at the moment. ¡°We will stick with this until there¡¯s a vote,¡± Mr. Feinblatt said. ¡°I don¡¯t know when that vote will take place, but I know that we will spend what it takes for as long as it takes.¡± Reid J.

Let me say it again, gun violence in this country is an epidemic, and it¡¯s an international embarrassment. [applause] Every day in this country, 316 people are shot every single day ? 106 of them die every day. Today, I asked the Justice Department to publish a model red flag legislation. So states can start crafting their own laws, right now. Just like with background checks, the vast majority of Americans support these extreme risk-protection order laws. And it¡¯s time to put these laws on the books, and protect even more people. Whether Congress acts or not, I¡¯m going to use all the resources at my disposal as president to keep the American people safe from gun violence. But there¡¯s much more that Congress can do to help that effort. And they can do it right now. They¡¯ve offered plenty of thoughts and prayers, members of Congress. But they passed not a single new federal law to reduce gun violence. Enough prayers. Time for some action. By Annie Karni President Biden, calling gun violence in the United States ¡°an international embarrassment,¡± took a set of initial steps on Thursday to address the problem, starting with a crackdown on the proliferation of so-called ghost guns, or firearms assembled from kits. Acknowledging that more aggressive actions like banning assault weapons and closing background check loopholes would have to wait for action from Congress, he said it was nonetheless vital to do what he could on his own to confront what he called an epidemic of shootings that are killing roughly 100 Americans a day. ¡°We¡¯ve got a long way to go ? it seems like we always have a long way to go,¡± Mr. Biden said during an appearance in the Rose Garden, weeks after two mass shootings. The most substantive of the steps was directing the Justice Department to curb the spread of ghost guns. Kits for these guns can be bought without background checks and allow a gun to be assembled from pieces with no serial numbers. Mr. Biden said he wanted the department to issue a regulation within a month to require that the components in the kits have serial numbers that would allow them to be traced and that the weapons be legally classified as firearms, with the buyers subjected to background checks. ¡°I want to see these kits treated as firearms under the gun control act,¡± Mr. Biden said. Ghost guns, experts said, have become particularly appealing to criminal organizations and right wing extremists who want untraceable firearms that do not require any background checks. They are often tied to shootings in states like California, which have instituted strict gun laws. transcript [GUN CLICKS] This is a gun I made myself. The government doesn¡¯t know I have it, but it¡¯s totally legal. You can buy a kit online with all the parts you need to build a Glock 19. You don¡¯t need a 3-D printer or fancy tools, and you don¡¯t need a background check. I purchased the Glock 19 during Glocktober, so I got $100 off. People call these ghost guns. And they¡¯re becoming more popular, especially for people who want a gun, but don¡¯t want any record that it exists. I¡¯d like to see how easy it is to build one of these guns and to find out what these kits mean for the future of gun regulation. Order is confirmed. All that¡¯s left to do is build it. I don¡¯t have a handgun license in New York, so I sent the kit to Virginia, where you don¡¯t need one. Let¡¯s make a gun. I get the appeal of making a gun. I like building stuff. And for a lot of people who buy these kits, that¡¯s the point. They¡¯re fun to make. ¡°Hey, guys. Today we¡¯re going to be going over how to build your Full Conceal Polymer80 frame. So it¡¯s actually fairly quick to do this.¡± ¡°Kind of paint by numbers in a sense.¡± The lower receiver or frame is the only part of the gun that¡¯s technically considered a firearm under U.S. law. Gun kits aren¡¯t regulated like firearms because they come with unfinished lower receivers. ¡°So this is the lower receiver, and it¡¯s in this jig. So what we¡¯ll need to do is remove the extra pieces that are sticking up out of the jig.¡± [SNAPPING] Yeah, instead of shop, I took early childhood development. It was actually really awesome. The finished lower receiver looks almost identical to the unfinished one. You just drill a few holes and remove these extra bits of polymer. Then you assemble and add the rest of the parts. If you do it right, you¡¯ll have a working firearm. On a factory-made gun, the serial number would go here. But the gun I¡¯m building won¡¯t have one, so there¡¯s no way to trace it. Gun kits aren¡¯t regulated at all in most states. There are no records of sales. And for a lot of people, that¡¯s the appeal. ¡°Hey.¡± ¡°Hey.¡± ¡°Andy Lander.¡± ¡°Jeremy White.¡± Andy Lander is a firearms expert who worked for the N.R.A. for 13 years. He¡¯s built guns before. ¡°We¡¯re still technically a free country. And I think that one of the greatest freedoms is having privacy. To me, if you bought 100 guns, it¡¯s none of my business.¡± It¡¯s impossible to say how many ghost guns are out there or who owns them. Last year, nearly a third of all firearms seized by law enforcement in California were homemade without serial numbers. Still, Andy says the kits aren¡¯t the problem. ¡°A criminal is going to steal a gun. He¡¯s going to either rob somebody and get a gun. He¡¯s going to get a gun anyway. I¡¯m not worried about a guy building a Glock 19 in his garage.¡± ¡°Nope. Drop it in from the top.¡± ¡°Drop it in.¡± ¡°Straight down.¡± ¡°Oh, it has to be all the way ?¡± ¡°You have to clear that, yeah. Push down till it pops. Yeah, that¡¯s it.¡± [GUN CLICKS] ¡°There you go. You¡¯re done.¡± ¡°Wow. Thanks for your help.¡± [GUN CLICKS] It took me about six hours to build my ghost gun. [GUN CLICKS] If I had to do it again, I could do it much faster. Still, there¡¯s no guarantee that it will work. ¡°Scot Thomasson.¡± ¡°Jeremy White.¡± ¡°Nice to meet you.¡± ¡°Good to meet you.¡± ¡°How are you?¡± ¡°Good.¡± ¡°Good. It¡¯s the same damn gun.¡± ¡°Really is.¡± ¡°The difference is right there, serial number. And that¡¯s important.¡± Scot Thomasson is a retired A.T.F. agent. He¡¯s letting me try out my new gun on his property. ¡°Looks O.K. Looks like it¡¯s not going to blow up anybody¡¯s hand, so that¡¯s a good thing.¡± ¡°Let¡¯s go test it out.¡± [GUN CLICKS] [GUN FIRES] ¡°Hit.¡± [GUN FIRES] ¡°Hit.¡± [GUN FIRES] ¡°O.K.¡± ¡°That¡¯s a working gun.¡± ¡°Yeah, sure enough is. Listen, I worked violent crime my whole career for 26 years. You want those officers to have every means possible bringing to justice those who use that firearm to commit acts of violence. And without a serial number on that firearm, you can¡¯t do it.¡± ¡°So if these kits had a serial number and were sold through licensed dealers, do you see any problem with that?¡± ¡°No problem whatsoever. So what?¡± ¡°Right now we really don¡¯t know what we don¡¯t know, because these guns are completely untraceable.¡± Jennifer Wexton is a representative from Virginia¡¯s 10th district and a co-sponsor on two bills that would broaden the definition of firearms to include assembly kits. so you couldn¡¯t buy them without the government knowing. ¡°Normally the serial number would be here.¡± ¡°No. And look, there¡¯s nothing there.¡± ¡°There¡¯s nothing there.¡± ¡°Yeah. That¡¯s part of the allure of these kinds of ghost guns, by the way. So when they¡¯re picked up in crime scenes and things like that, we know that they are out there. And we¡¯re seeing it happen more and more.¡± ¡°What do you say to the Second Amendment advocate that says, these laws are an invasion of my privacy when it comes to gun ownership?¡± ¡°I think that guns should be traceable. So I think that weighing the interest in not having a serial number on your firearm versus the overall public safety, I come down on the side of public safety.¡± In the end, the government does find out about my ghost gun. Without a handgun license, I can¡¯t bring this gun back to New York, so I¡¯m turning it in to the local police. They interview me, do a background check and file a police report. That¡¯s a lot more screening than I went through to get the gun in the first place. For most people, this isn¡¯t the easiest way to get a gun. It takes time and skill. Some people may like that challenge. Most people would rather just buy one from a gun shop or a licensed dealer. But if you¡¯re a felon, or underage, or you can¡¯t legally buy a gun for some other reason, these kits make it remarkably easy to get one anyway. The president on Thursday outlined several other actions he was taking on his own. He said he would require that when a device known as a stabilizing brace effectively transforms a pistol into a short-barrel rifle, that weapon would be subject to the requirements of the National Firearms Act. That would subject those guns to extra layers of regulation required to own more serious firearms or silencers, including fingerprinting, a background check and a regular renewal of a license. The gunman in the Boulder, Colo., shooting last month used a pistol with an arm brace, making it more stable and accurate, the president said. Mr. Biden said the Justice Department would also publish model ¡°red flag¡± legislation for states. The measure would allow police officers and family members to petition a court to temporarily remove firearms from people who may present a danger to themselves or others. While the president cannot pass national red flag legislation without Congress, officials said the goal of the guidance was to make it easier for states that want to adopt it to do so now. ¡°Red flag laws can stop mass shooters before they can act out their violent plans,¡± Mr. Biden said, adding that he wanted to see a national law. Outside of mass shootings, gun violence remains the leading cause of death for Black men between the ages of 15 and 34, Mr. Biden said in his remarks, noting that additional funding he has proposed for community violence programs can save lives. The initiatives announced Thursday do not match in scope his commitment to the issue over the course of his career, particularly his time as a senator. In 1993, Mr. Biden played a key role in the passage of the landmark Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act. A year later, he helped authorize a 10-year ban on assault weapons. Mr. Biden acknowledged there is only so much he can do without Congress. ¡°This is just a start,¡± he said. ¡°We have a lot of work to do.¡± The House passed two gun control bills last month, but they are languishing in the Senate in the face of the chamber¡¯s 60-vote threshold for passing most legislation, which requires the support of at least 10 Republicans. Mr. Biden called on the Senate to take action. Mr. Biden also announced his nomination of David Chipman, a gun control advocate, to lead the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The bureau has not had a permanent director since 2015. While Mr. Chipman¡¯s selection came as welcome news to gun control groups, few nominees put forward by Mr. Biden have faced steeper odds of confirmation in the Senate. Still, his allies think he may be able to win narrow approval given the anguish over recent shootings. In 2006, lawmakers allied with the National Rifle Association enacted a provision making the position of A.T.F. director, which had previously been a political appointment, subject to Senate confirmation. As a result, only one director, Obama nominee B. Todd Jones, has been confirmed over the last 15 years. Annie Karni is a White House correspondent.

By J. David Goodman,?Amy Harmon and Adeel Hassan Follow updates about the mass shootings in California. There was the mass shooting near a youth center in Allentown, Pa., and the one at a Subway restaurant in Durham, N.C. Another took place behind a beer hall in Oklahoma City, and another at a strip club outside Columbus, Ohio. Two mass shootings ended parties in different Florida cities. And that was just on New Year¡¯s Day. By the start of the fourth week in January, the tally had grown to include at least 39 separate shootings in which four or more people were injured or killed, according to the Gun Violence Archive, outlining a striking explosion of violence across a range of sites in nearly every corner of the nation that killed at least 69 people. The deadliest shooting so far took place over the weekend in of Monterey Park, Calif., a city with a thriving Asian American community where a gunman killed 11 people and wounded nine others inside a popular ballroom dance hall. The authorities said the gunman, who may have targeted his victims and who later killed himself, was a 72-year-old man. Then, on Monday, came another deadly mass shooting in California. A gunman, whom the authorities said was a 66-year-old man, killed seven people and seriously wounded at least one other person in Half Moon Bay, south of San Francisco. ¡°At the hospital meeting with victims of a mass shooting when I get pulled away to be briefed about another shooting,¡± Gov. Gavin Newsom of California tweeted on Monday. ¡°Tragedy upon tragedy.¡± The frequency of mass shootings and the variety of places in which they now take place ? at offices and schools, nail salons and houses of worship, grocery stores and restaurants ? contributes to the sense, prevalent across America, that such violence could break out at any moment, anywhere. It fuels calls for gun control just as certainly as it does the purchase of more and more guns. Public shooting sprees rivet the nation, but can also have the effect of normalizing violence. Criminologists say the prevalence of mass shootings is brought about in part by the easy access to so many weapons ? a unique feature of the United States ? as well as by a copycat effect. ¡°Would someone like this have committed a mass shooting at a dance hall in the past?¡± Adam Lankford, a criminologist at the University of Alabama, said, referring to the older man believed to have been the gunman in Monterey Park. ¡°Maybe not. You can kind of think of it as a snowball effect. The more incidents there are, the more prominent this option will be in angry people¡¯s minds.¡± And at the same time, the recurrence of such gun violence risks having the effect of desensitizing the nation to tragedy, so much so that warnings not to become accustomed to high-profile mass shootings are a familiar part of the response. ¡°We cannot become numb to these horrific acts of violence,¡± the district attorney of San Francisco, Brooke Jenkins, said after the Monterey Park shooting, which took place amid Lunar New Year celebrations over the weekend. ¡°The year of the Rabbit stands for hope.¡± There is little official consensus on what constitutes a mass shooting; different organizations use different measures. But so far this year, the vast majority of the 39 shootings in which at least four people were struck by bullets ? the measure used by the Gun Violence Archive, a research group ? attracted little to no attention beyond the areas where they took place. Who outside of Houston would be aware that two such shootings have taken place there this year ? a drive-by shooting in which four people were struck; another that killed one person outside a Houston club and involved an AK-47 assault-style rifle. ¡°It looks like over 50 shots were fired here, which is a very scary situation,¡± the local sheriff, Ed Gonzalez, told reporters. Such shootings often make the evening news but fail to pierce the broad consciousness of the cities where they take place, even as they leave victims and bystanders with lasting wounds and mental scars. ¡°I was terrified ? everybody was just running,¡± Carl Leon, a 25-year-old from Miami, said as he described the moment that gunfire began outside a soul food restaurant in Miami Gardens this month. Mr. Leon, who promotes musicians on his Instagram account, had just finished appearing as an extra in a video shoot for the rapper French Montana, he said, and was fishing around in his pocket for keys when he was hit. A bullet pierced his left arm and tore through his abdomen. ¡°I thought I was going to die,¡± he said. ¡°It was my first time being in a situation like this.¡± But the Miami Gardens shooting was not the first mass shooting for his lawyer, Josiah Graham, who represented one of the survivors of a shooting on a Broward County bus last year that killed two people and wounded two others. It was not even the first mass shooting in the city of Miami Gardens this year. Nine people were injured in a shooting at a party in the early hours of New Year¡¯s Day. ¡°Back in the day, it used to be if you stay away from certain things, you were good,¡± said Shanta Bonius, the mother of Carlos Wilkerson, 23, one of the 10 people shot and injured, including Mr. Leon, outside the restaurant in Miami Gardens. ¡°Nowadays you could just be minding your business, going to the grocery store, and something happens. ¡± The number of mass shootings has been rising, though not steadily, since 2014, according to data compiled by the Gun Violence Archive, which tracks public reports of shootings. There were 690 shootings with four or more victims in 2021, more than double the 2014 total. The number fell slightly last year, to 647, but remained significantly higher than in previous years. And the number of such shootings appears to be rising in the first few weeks of this year, as compared with similar periods in recent years. There has been, on average, fewer than one mass shooting per day from Jan. 1 to Jan. 23 in each of the last five years, according to the Gun Violence Archive data, but the last two years have been trending up, to 28 last year from 26 in 2021, and 16 in 2018. ¡°There is no place left in America that is safe from gun violence,¡± David Min, a California state senator, said in response to the Monterey Park shooting. ¡°This has to stop. Enough is enough.¡± Even as crime rates decline, gun violence is on the rise, said Jaclyn Schildkraut, executive director of the regional gun violence research consortium at the Rockefeller Institute of Government. But Dr. Schildkraut said it was important to distinguish between ¡°public mass shootings¡± like those in Monterey Park, which are known to be premeditated, and other categories, like killings among family members, retaliatory gang shootings or shootings that erupt out of an argument. Public mass shootings are the least common and the most deadly, she said. And the type of policy interventions that are most likely to avert them are different. ¡°All gun violence and the loss of any one individual is one too many,¡± Ms. Schildkraut said. ¡°They are different buckets that require us to think about their unique characteristics and add in layers of prevention and response accordingly.¡± A 2015 study linked the nation¡¯s high rate of mass shootings to its high rate of gun ownership. Americans make up about 5 percent of the global population and own 42 percent of the world¡¯s guns, the study said. It is difficult to calculate the precise number of guns sold each year in the United States, because of varying state laws and purchase scenarios. But F.B.I. data on the number of firearm background checks can serve as a measure. By that count, the totals have swelled to 40 million background checks in 2021 from 10 million in 2005. But subsequent work suggests that the governing factor may be easy access to guns, not ownership of them, said Mr. Lankford, the University of Alabama criminologist, who wrote the 2015 study. Nearly 40 percent of American men tell researchers that they own a gun, so gun ownership alone is not a useful predictor of who is likely to commit a mass shooting, Mr. Lankford said. In a study of the 14 deadliest mass shootings since Columbine, he and a co-author showed that half of the perpetrators had not acquired their first firearm until the final year before their attack. In many of the less widely reported mass shootings that take place in the United States, information about the gunman and the weapon used is not readily known. After 12 people were shot in Baton Rouge, La., over the weekend, three with what were described as life-threatening injuries, the police implored people with information to come forward with information about the gunman. In Rockford, Ill., northwest of Chicago, three people died and two others were injured in a shooting this month, and a suspect has yet to be identified publicly. ¡°You wish there was the same attention that was put on these everyday shootings,¡± the mayor of Rockford, Tom McNamara, said in an interview. ¡°I don¡¯t want to sound callous about Monterey Park, but at least those people are going to be remembered,¡± he added. ¡°Last year I lost 15 lives in my community. There was no national story about it. It¡¯s just sad that we live in a country where violence is normalized.¡± Kirsten Noyes contributed research. J.

https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/26/us/politics/cory-booker-gun-control.html?searchResultPosition=93,2019-06-26,Cory Booker on Gun Control,"Mr. Booker, a senator from New Jersey, has put forth a 14-part plan, the most notable piece of which is a gun-licensing program. By Nick Corasaniti Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey introduced a 14-part plan earlier this year to address gun violence, and it is one of the most progressive gun-control measures suggested by a candidate seeking the Democratic presidential nomination. The most notable piece of Mr. Booker¡¯s platform is a gun-licensing program. The campaign says the process for obtaining a license would be similar to applying for or renewing a passport: A person hoping to buy a gun would submit fingerprints, sit for an interview, and demonstrate completion of a certified gun-safety course, then undergo a comprehensive background check.  Mr. Booker also proposed to ban assault weapons, high-capacity magazines and so-called ¡°bump stocks,¡± which allow semiautomatic rifles to function like automatic weapons, and would limit handgun purchases to one per month.  His plan also calls for closing existing gun purchasing loopholes and for providing dedicated funding for research on gun violence as a public health issue. Mr. Booker lives in Newark, a city in New Jersey that struggles with gun violence on a daily basis, and Mr. Booker claims a personal connection to the issue. A key line of his stump speech is his pledge to ¡°bring the fight to the corporate gun lobby like it¡¯s never seen before.¡± He uses his gun control plan to back up that promise.  Predictably, Mr. Booker¡¯s plan has drawn condemnation and criticism from gun rights advocates, giving the senator a foil to continue discussing his platform. Multiple efforts at the federal level to overhaul, or even slightly modify, the nation¡¯s gun laws have failed.  Though Mr. Booker could address some parts of his platform through executive action if elected president, he would need to work with Congress to establish some of his more sweeping proposals, making the path forward more difficult.

https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/16/us/politics/red-flag-laws-mass-shootings.html?searchResultPosition=94,2023-01-16,A Florida School Received a Threat. Did a Red Flag Law Prevent a Shooting?,"Judges in 19 states and the District of Columbia are issuing orders to keep guns out of the hands of people deemed dangerous, like a Fort Lauderdale teenager who threatened a school shooting. By Sheryl Gay Stolberg FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. ? Seagull Alternative High School sits behind locked gates and a chain-link fence, a complex of low-slung buildings that provides an academic home for pregnant teenagers and students at risk of dropping out. On a Tuesday in early October, it was a target of the kind of threat that every school official dreads. ¡°I just might come to yo school and kill everybody,¡± a 17-year-old who had previously attended the school wrote in an Instagram message to a student, according to police records. He singled out the principal and a behavioral specialist and sent a chilling photograph: a handgun and an assault rifle, splayed out on a bed, with Seagull Alternative High School written across the top of the image. Informed of the threat, law enforcement officials in Fort Lauderdale moved quickly. Making use of Florida¡¯s so-called red flag law, the police obtained an order from a judge allowing them to remove any guns in the young man¡¯s possession. Gun safety activists and public health experts say that such orders ? often known as extreme risk protection orders, or ERPOs ? are a way to prevent mass shootings in a country that has been plagued by them. Nineteen states and the District of Columbia now have red flag laws, up from just two states a decade ago. Advocates are pressing for more states ? including Michigan and Minnesota, where Democrats recently took control of state legislatures ? to pass them this year. Only two states controlled by Republicans, Florida and Indiana, have such laws. Nineteen states and the District of Columbia have red flag laws, which authorize courts to issue temporary orders enabling law enforcement to remove firearms from people who are deemed dangerous.  Here¡¯s how the laws work ¡æ If a gun owner poses a threat, the police ? and in some states, family members ? may petition a judge for an order, often called an extreme risk protection order. The subject of an order must surrender his or her weapons to law enforcement and is barred from purchasing firearms for a limited period of time. There are no criminal penalties for extreme risk protection orders because they are civil orders. There are two types: An emergency order, issued in the face of an immediate threat, lasts for a short period of time, often 14 days. A final order is issued after a judge holds a hearing. It typically lasts no more than a year before it must be renewed. Instead of issuing a final order, a judge can also order the weapons returned to their owner. Gun rights groups say that red flag laws violate due process ? the right to have one¡¯s case heard in court ? and they argue that the laws do not work. Backers of the laws say the problem is they are not used often enough. In a bipartisan gun safety bill enacted last year, Congress provided funding to help states set up or bolster red flag laws. Advocates hope that Michigan and Minnesota, where Democrats recently took control of state legislatures, will pass their own laws this year. Read more about red flag laws: Gun rights groups argue that the laws violate due process ? the right to have one¡¯s case heard in court. Erich Pratt, the senior vice president of Gun Owners of America, said the laws ¡°don¡¯t work,¡± citing back-to-back mass shootings in November in Colorado, which adopted a red flag law in 2019, and Virginia, which did so in 2020. But a growing body of public health research suggests that the laws may prevent gun violence at least some of the time. A recent six-state study of more than 6,700 ERPO cases found that nearly 10 percent involved threats to kill at least three people. Indeed, backers say the laws are not being used aggressively enough because law enforcement agencies lack the training or bandwidth to pursue court orders, and many people do not know the laws exist. Congress, recognizing these problems, passed bipartisan legislation last year that provides $750 million for state crisis intervention programs, including red flag laws. ¡°People are quick to say, ¡®You have this tool, you didn¡¯t use it, what went wrong here?¡¯¡± said Lisa Geller, a researcher at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who studies policies to reduce gun violence. ¡°Yes, these incidents still happen. But states are using their ERPO laws in ways that you wouldn¡¯t know about because the shooting never happened.¡± There was no shooting at Seagull Alternative High School. The threat and the resulting risk protection order against the former student offer a case study in how such orders work ? and why some judges and law enforcement officers are uneasy about them, especially when they involve juveniles. The investigation in Fort Lauderdale began when a female student alerted a school police officer, who called Detective Cody Campbell, a member of the Fort Lauderdale Police Department¡¯s six-person threat response unit. Within hours, Detective Campbell said in an interview, he, the former student and the former student¡¯s mother were meeting in a shopping mall parking lot. The detective wanted the young man¡¯s phone and the mother¡¯s help so he could confirm whether her son had weapons. The mother refused, he said: ¡°There wasn¡¯t a lot of cooperation.¡± In a brief telephone interview, a woman who identified herself as the teenager¡¯s mother declined to comment. It was a long night for Detective Campbell. ¡°We burned the midnight oil,¡± he said, drafting paperwork asking a court to issue a risk protection order, as well as warrants for Instagram and the young man¡¯s wireless phone provider and to search his home. The requests were granted. But the results of the search were not what the detective expected. Nationally, more than 20,000 petitions for extreme risk protection orders were filed from 1999 to 2021, according to data collected by Everytown for Gun Safety, an advocacy group. A vast majority of those petitions ? more than 18,600 ? were filed after the 2018 massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, a Fort Lauderdale suburb. Florida ? a state controlled by Republicans, who have traditionally been loath to impose restrictions on gun ownership ? enacted its red flag law in response to that shooting. Its courts handled more than 8,100 petitions for risk protection orders from 2018 to 2021, according to Everytown. In Fort Lauderdale, the memory of Parkland is strong. Detective Chris Carita, who has a master¡¯s degree in public health from Johns Hopkins, trains fellow officers in how to use the state¡¯s red flag law. On a recent Wednesday, he could be found in a bare-bones classroom with seven new officers. ¡°Law enforcement is a gun culture; the thought of taking someone¡¯s firearms away may not sit well with us, right?¡± he told them. ¡°That really is a problem for some of us, and so it¡¯s important to understand the legal framework for these laws so that you can be comfortable and understand why it¡¯s being used and how it¡¯s being used.¡± There are roughly 17,500 state and local law enforcement agencies in the United States; about 85 percent of them have fewer than 50 full-time officers. Many are unable to provide the kind of training available in Fort Lauderdale, said Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, a nonprofit in Washington. Even in bigger police departments, getting officers accustomed to using the orders can be a challenge. In Fairfax County, Va., Chief Kevin Davis has assigned a single officer to manage all emergency substantial risk orders, as they are called in that state. His department obtained 11 orders in 2020 and 26 in 2021. Last year, the number jumped to 80. Red flag laws are not only used to thwart criminal activity; often, they are directed at someone who is in a mental health crisis or contemplating suicide. Some states allow family members to seek the orders. Two state lawmakers are pressing legislation to permit that in Florida as well. In two oft-cited papers that helped make the case for the laws, Jeffrey W. Swanson, a professor in psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Duke University, studied their effects on suicides in the first two states to adopt them: Connecticut and Indiana. He calculated that for every 10 to 20 people who had guns taken away, one life was saved. The six-state study found that of the extreme risk protection order cases related to threats to shoot three or more people, about half involved the kinds of ¡°public mass shootings that we all fear,¡± said the lead researcher, April M. Zeoli of the University of Michigan¡¯s Institute for Firearm Injury Prevention. K-12 schools and businesses were the most common targets for those large-scale threats. ¡°The big conclusion is that these really are being used in cases of multiple-victim mass shooting threats,¡± Dr. Zeoli said. ¡°And these threats are largely determined to be credible by judges.¡± Experts say it is extremely difficult to predict who will carry out a school shooting. But if there is a profile, the teenager in Fort Lauderdale seemed to fit it; past school shootings have often been committed by young men, including teenagers, who have signaled their intentions. It took less than a day for the Fort Lauderdale police, working with the department¡¯s legal adviser, to build a case for a risk protection order in response to the threat against Seagull Alternative High School. In an affidavit supporting their petition to the court, Detective Campbell wrote that the young man had told the female student over Instagram that he would ¡°kill the principal y he walking to his car.¡± A background check, the detective wrote, revealed that the former student was facing 13 felony and two misdemeanor charges, including robbery, carjacking and battery, stemming from previous episodes. He had also received a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder, a condition in which patients experience psychotic symptoms, including hallucinations and delusions. Experts say that only a small percentage of people with mental illness are violent. But the young man had been involuntarily detained eight times for psychiatric evaluation since 2020. In one previous interaction with the police, he said he was ¡°tired of the world and wants to kill everyone,¡± the detective wrote. Extreme risk protection orders are civil and carry no criminal penalties; as a result, the young man was not entitled to a public defender. That troubles Chief Judge Jack Tuter of Florida¡¯s 17th Judicial Circuit, which includes Fort Lauderdale. While he said he supported the state¡¯s red flag law, Judge Tuter, who was not involved in the young man¡¯s case, said he was concerned about people under 18 who lack legal representation. ¡°There is a due process aspect to juveniles ? there always has been,¡± he said. With the risk protection order and a search warrant in hand, the entire threat response team, along with a backup crew, parked themselves near the former student¡¯s home. Hoping to avoid a confrontation at the front door, the officers watched him leave the house and served him the warrant during a traffic stop. What they found when they searched the home surprised them. There were no guns. Detectives Carita and Campbell said they believed, but could not be certain, that the young man ? aware that he was being watched ? stashed the weapons that had appeared in the Instagram picture elsewhere. That, however, is not the end of the story. At the end of November, Detective Campbell was called to the teenager¡¯s home to respond to an episode in which the young man ¡°was alleged to have discharged a firearm multiple times, with one round ultimately striking his sister in the hand,¡± according to a police report. After being informed of his right to remain silent, the report said, the teenager admitted to owning and firing the gun that police recovered at the time of the shooting. He was arrested, charged with violating his risk protection order and transported to a juvenile assessment center. The police said that a criminal investigation was active, and they would not comment on how or when the young man obtained the gun. To Judge Tuter, that turn of events raises questions. ¡°What good did the risk protection order do,¡± he said, ¡°if at the end of the day, he ended up getting a gun, which he was prohibited from doing; he ended up getting ammunition, which he was prohibited from doing; and he ended up using the gun?¡± The police, however, are convinced that they prevented a mass tragedy that would have been perpetrated by an unstable young man who had a violent past, made a specific threat to kill school officials and students, and apparently had the means to carry it out. ¡°Based on his history, his posts and subsequent events, it¡¯s very obvious that he is capable of violence,¡± Detective Campbell said. ¡°When a person like that makes those kinds of statements, you have to take it very seriously.¡± Sheryl Gay Stolberg is a Washington Correspondent covering health policy.

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/24/us/politics/white-house-gun-control-executive-orders.html?searchResultPosition=95,2021-04-03,White House Weighs Executive Orders on Gun Control,"A day after President Biden called on Congress to pass a new assault weapons ban and tougher background checks, the administration was considering steps it could take without legislation. transcript Congressional legislation, as the vice president conveyed this morning, obviously has a more permanent, lasting impact. Executive actions are, of course, an important lever that every president has at their disposal. There¡¯s current discussions and analysis internally of what steps can be taken ? that has been ongoing for several weeks, even before these two recent tragedies that, you know, he looks forward to getting an update on and seeing what can be moved forward on that front as well. No one is talking about overturning or changing the Second Amendment. What our focus is on is putting in place common-sense measures that will make our communities safer, make families safer, make kids safer. The majority of the American public supports background checks. The majority of the American public does not believe that anyone needs to have an assault weapon. By Annie Karni WASHINGTON ? With Congress unlikely to move quickly on gun legislation, the White House is pressing ahead with plans for a series of executive orders that President Biden expects to roll out in the coming weeks as a way of keeping up pressure on the issue. A day after Mr. Biden called on the Senate to pass a ban on assault weapons and strengthen background checks in response to a pair of mass shootings in the past week that left 18 people dead, White House officials said on Wednesday that while moving legislation on gun safety remained a goal, it would take time, given the vehement opposition from Republicans. Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said that legislation was necessary to make permanent changes. But she also suggested that the executive actions under consideration could be a realistic starting place. ¡°There¡¯s lots of leverage you can take, obviously, as president and vice president,¡± she said. For now, administration officials have been reaching out to Democrats in the Senate to consult with them about three executive actions. One would classify as firearms so-called ghost guns ? kits that allow a gun to be assembled from pieces. Another would fund community violence intervention programs, and the third would strengthen the background checks system, according to congressional aides familiar with the conversations. Aware that any executive actions on guns will face legal challenges, the White House Counsel¡¯s Office has also been vetting those actions to make sure they can withstand judicial review, officials said. A White House spokesman declined to comment on the coming actions. But Mr. Biden is under pressure from gun safety groups to act as soon as possible. ¡°If there¡¯s one thing we learned in this past year is inaction cost lives,¡± said John Feinblatt, the president of Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun violence prevention organization. ¡°This isn¡¯t about next week, it¡¯s not about next month, it has to be about today. It has to be immediate.¡± During his campaign, Mr. Biden, a prominent supporter of the 10-year assault weapons ban in 1994, promised to enact universal background check legislation, prohibit all online sales of firearms and ban the manufacture and sale of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. But Mr. Biden has acknowledged that he does not know what legislation might be possible, even after the recent shootings in Atlanta and Boulder. ¡°I haven¡¯t done any counting yet,¡± he said on Tuesday, when asked if he had the political capital to move forward with any gun safety measures. With the National Rifle Association, once the most powerful lobbying organization in the country, tied up in bankruptcy and spending more money on legal fees than on fighting the White House or Congress, Mr. Biden could have more room to maneuver. Since the transition, Biden administration officials have met regularly with Mr. Feinblatt and other proponents of gun control to talk about what actions are possible that do not need cooperation from Congress. The ideas they have discussed include the Federal Trade Commission evaluating gun ads for safety claims that are false or misleading, the Education Department promoting interventions that prevent students from gaining access to firearms and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention being required to provide reliable data tracking gunshot injuries. They have also discussed whether to declare gun violence a public health emergency ? a move that would free up more funding that could be used to support community gun violence programs and enforcement of current laws. ¡°The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has funding to inspect the average gun dealer every five years,¡± said Kris Brown, the president of Brady: United Against Gun Violence, a nonprofit group. ¡°We have more gun dealers than Starbucks and McDonald¡¯s.¡± Designating gun violence as a public health crisis, Ms. Brown said, would make more money available that would allow for more regular inspections. That was one proposal, she said, that was shared with the Biden transition teams. ¡°We also discussed what can be done through agencies like the Department of Health and Human Services to incentivize the health care community to focus on preventive measures that can stop gun violence before it starts,¡± Ms. Brown said. For now, one of the administration¡¯s biggest pushes has been on classifying ¡°ghost guns,¡± as firearms. Such a classification would require them to be serialized and subject to background checks. The administration has also discussed with Democratic senators its still-nascent plans to fund community-based violence intervention programs. How much funding is still up for debate. During the campaign, Mr. Biden promised to create a $900 million, eight-year initiative to fund evidence-based interventions in 40 cities across the country. ¡°There are programs across this country doing proven work,¡± Ms. Brown said. ¡°But they¡¯re drastically underfunded. We want a $5 billion investment in those kinds of violence intervention programs across the country.¡± White House officials described a ¡°robust interagency process¡± but said its planned executive actions were not yet finished. Although there are no plans for any imminent legislative push on guns from a White House that is dealing with crises on multiple fronts, Mr. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have continued to describe legislative action as an imperative. ¡°I¡¯m not willing to give up on what we must do to appeal to the hearts and minds and the reason of the members of the United States Senate,¡± Ms. Harris said on Wednesday in an interview with ¡°CBS This Morning.¡± ¡°It is time for Congress to act and stop with the false choices,¡± she said. ¡°This is not about getting rid of the Second Amendment. It¡¯s simply about saying we need reasonable gun safety laws. There is no reason why we have assault weapons on the streets of a civil society. They are weapons of war. They are designed to kill a lot of people quickly.¡± Annie Karni is a congressional correspondent. She was previously a White House correspondent.

https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/23/us/colorado-shooting-red-flag-law.html?searchResultPosition=96,2022-11-23,Could the Colorado Shooting Have Been Prevented?,"The state¡¯s red-flag law allows relatives or law enforcement officials to ask a court to seize guns from someone who is deemed dangerous, but it is not used as often in Colorado as in other states. By Jack Healy,?Simon Romero,?Mitch Smith,?Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs and Adam Goldman COLORADO SPRINGS ? Seven years after his son, Alex, was killed in a mass shooting at a theater in suburban Denver, State Representative Tom Sullivan helped lead the effort to enact a red-flag law in Colorado. The law, passed in 2019, allows a person¡¯s relatives or law enforcement officers to ask a court to make the person relinquish their guns if the person is deemed to be dangerous. But as Mr. Sullivan¡¯s state reels this week from another mass shooting ? this time at an L.G.B.T.Q. nightclub in Colorado Springs, where five people were killed and 18 more injured ? a key limitation of red-flag laws has once again become clear: In order for them to work, they have to be used. ¡°Someone could¡¯ve done something beforehand so that guy never had that firepower,¡± Mr. Sullivan, a Democrat, said about the latest shooting. ¡°Therein lies the problem.¡± Much remains unknown about the massacre in Colorado Springs and about the suspect, Anderson Lee Aldrich, 22, who is being held on suspicion of murder and hate crimes, and who made an initial court appearance in the case Wednesday. Even so, enough information has become public ? including about an incident last year in which officials say the same suspect was arrested after a report of a bomb threat ? to raise questions about whether Colorado¡¯s red-flag law could have staved off tragedy. ¡°It makes me question why we pass laws in the first place, if the powers that be won¡¯t enforce them,¡± said John Loveall, whose son, Jerecho, was wounded in the rampage Saturday night at Club Q, a beloved nightclub and longtime hub of the L.G.B.T.Q. community in Colorado Springs. Red-flag laws and the court actions they authorize, known as extreme risk protection orders, have been a legislative priority for Democrats, and occasionally Republicans, in recent years. Supporters say the measures provide a way to ensure that people in crisis do not have access to guns that they might use to harm themselves or others. Generally, a criminal conviction is not required before petitioning a court to take away weapons under such laws. In Colorado, no conviction is necessary. Even the most fervent defenders of the laws, which exist in some form in 19 states, acknowledge that they are not a panacea. The laws do not apply in every situation, and they can only be used if residents or law enforcement agencies know they exist and initiate the process by asking a judge to invoke them. Still, in a country plagued by mass shootings and other gun violence, questioning whether there were missed opportunities to use a red-flag law has become a familiar pattern. In Indiana, the police seized a shotgun in 2020 from the home of a man whose mother had raised alarms about his mental state. But prosecutors did not invoke the state¡¯s red-flag law, which could have prevented him from purchasing more guns. A few months later, the man legally bought rifles that he used in 2021 to kill eight people at a FedEx facility in Indianapolis. In Illinois, which has strict gun laws, including a red-flag measure, the man prosecutors have accused of killing seven people at a Fourth of July parade this year in Highland Park was able to buy guns despite concerning encounters with law enforcement. In 2019, officers seized 16 knives, a dagger and a sword from his home while responding to reports that he had been making threats. The local police filed a report saying he was a ¡°clear and present danger,¡± but the man was later issued a state license to own guns. In Colorado, the El Paso County Sheriff¡¯s Office, which handled the investigation of the bomb threat last year involving the club shooting suspect, declined to answer questions this week about the red-flag law. Colorado Springs officials also declined to discuss the specifics of whether the law could have been used against the suspect, though they cautioned in broad terms that there were limits to the law¡¯s application. Colorado¡¯s law is relatively new, and Attorney General Phil Weiser, a Democrat, said it was too early to make any judgment about whether using it could have prevented the shooting in Colorado Springs. The authorities have not said how the suspect acquired the guns found at the scene. But Mr. Weiser said that the state needed to do more to reach out to law enforcement agencies about using red-flag orders, as well as telling the public that the law even exists. There have been 211 filings for red-flag orders in Colorado over the past two fiscal years, which run from July through June, according to state statistics. An Associated Press analysis found that Colorado has not been issuing the orders as often as other states with red-flag laws do. ¡°We need people to know they can go somewhere and they can share the information, and it can save lives,¡± Mr. Weiser said. ¡°The critical challenge ahead of us is awareness and use of the law.¡± Allison Anderman, the senior counsel and director of local policy at the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, advised Colorado lawmakers before they passed the red-flag bill. She said it was wrong to try to evaluate the effectiveness of a law that was so little used. ¡°I hear a lot of ¡®It¡¯s not working because it didn¡¯t stop this mass shooting¡¯ criticism of this law and others, and I think that¡¯s a logical fallacy,¡± Ms. Anderman said. ¡°I don¡¯t think you can say ¡®Because no one tried to use the law, it didn¡¯t work.¡¯¡± When the bill became law, some sheriffs, including in El Paso County, which includes Colorado Springs, voiced skepticism, worrying that the measure could be used to infringe on Second Amendment rights and take guns from people without due process. In Weld County, northeast of Denver, Sheriff Steve Reams said his office has never tried to invoke the law.  In the wake of the Colorado Springs shooting, Sheriff Reams, a Republican, said he believed there should be more focus on trying to improve mental health support for people who may pose a danger. ¡°I don¡¯t think red flag is the problem or the solution here,¡± he said. ¡°We have a broken mental health system in the state of Colorado and nationwide that simply had no way to deal with this guy.¡± Anderson Lee Aldrich has not yet been formally charged in the Colorado Springs shooting, and does not have any known criminal record.  According to two law enforcement officials, the same person was arrested last year outside Colorado Springs after the suspect¡¯s mother reported that the suspect had made threats about a homemade bomb and other weapons. No court files related to that case are public. The sheriff¡¯s office issued a news release describing a frightening scene in which nearby homes were evacuated and a negotiation team was used to make an arrest. Attempts to reach the suspect¡¯s mother have been unsuccessful. A lack of witness cooperation prevented a prosecution from proceeding in the 2021 case, according to law enforcement officials, who confirmed that the person arrested in the incident was Anderson Lee Aldrich. Officials have repeatedly declined to discuss that case on the record, and have not confirmed publicly that the person arrested last year was the same person being held in connection to the nightclub shooting. In court filings late Tuesday, Anderson Lee Aldrich¡¯s public defenders said their client identifies as nonbinary and prefers to be referred to as they and them. District Attorney Michael J. Allen said the suspect¡¯s gender identity would not affect his approach to the case or influence whether he files hate-crime charges against the suspect. Interviews and public records revealed that the suspect had a chaotic childhood. The family moved frequently, and the accused sought a legal name change as a teenager and had limited contact with Aaron Franklin Brink, their father.  Across Colorado Springs, as vigils continued and officials made plans to hang a pride flag from City Hall, some residents wondered whether a different response to the bomb threat a year ago might have prevented the shooting. Cole Wist, a former Republican state legislator from suburban Denver who once pushed for a red-flag measure, said he was disappointed, though not surprised, that the law was not used in the Colorado Springs case. Mr. Wist later left the Republican Party and is now an independent. ¡°This is a textbook example,¡± he said, ¡°of when the law should be applied.¡± Reporting was contributed by Livia Albeck-Ripka, Elizabeth Dias, Adam Goldman, Shawn Hubler, Vik Jolly and Sheryl Gay Stolberg.

And after a minute, I could ask for a moment of silence for the 29 mass shootings that occurred this month in the United States. But in addition to a moment of silence, I would like to ask for a moment of action. Prayer leaders have their important place in this, but we are Senate leaders. What are we doing?¡± ¡°Like many Americans, I cherish my right to bear arms in the dialogue about gun control. We rarely consider how many Americans are united in their advocacy and enjoyment of this right.¡± ¡°America awoke today to another nightmare. Stunning, shocking, savage, but unsurprising. Inaction has made this horror completely predictable. Inaction by this Congress makes us complicit.¡± ¡°And every time there¡¯s a shooting, we play this ridiculous theater. Where this committee gets together and proposes a bunch of laws that would do nothing to stop these murders.¡± By Catie Edmondson Senators quickly splintered along partisan lines over gun control measures on Tuesday as Democrats demanded action in the wake of two mass shootings in the past week and Republicans denounced their calls, highlighting the political divide that has fueled a decades-long cycle of inaction on gun violence. At a hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee that was scheduled before shootings in Atlanta and Boulder that left at least 18 people dead, Democrats argued that the latest carnage left Congress no choice but to enact stricter policies. They lamented the grim pattern of anguish and outrage followed by partisanship and paralysis had become the norm following mass shootings. ¡°In addition to a moment of silence, I would like to ask for a moment of action,¡± said Senator Dick Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, and the chairman of the committee. ¡°A moment of real caring. A moment when we don¡¯t allow others to do what we need to do. Prayer leaders have their important place in this, but we are Senate leaders. What are we doing?¡± Even before the recent shootings, Democrats had already begun advancing stricter gun control measures that face long odds in the 50-50 Senate. House Democrats passed two bills this month aimed at expanding and strengthening background checks for gun buyers, by applying them to all gun buyers and extending the time the F.B.I. has to vet those flagged by the national instant check system. But the twin pieces of legislation passed in the House have been deemed too expansive by most Republicans ? only eight House Republicans voted to advance the universal background check legislation. The bills would almost certainly not muster the 60 votes needed to clear a filibuster in the Senate. Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa, the top Republican on the panel, said in his opening remarks that he was hopeful Democrats and Republicans could work together to make ¡°bipartisan, common-sense¡± progress on gun control. But he said that the House-passed legislation did not fit that bill, since the measures passed almost entirely along party lines. ¡°That is not a good sign that all voices and all perspectives are being considered,¡± Mr. Grassley said. Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, went further, lashing out at Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, who said that Republicans had offered ¡°fig leaves¡± rather than actionable, significant solutions to gun control. ¡°Every time there¡¯s a shooting, we play this ridiculous theater where this committee gets together and proposes a bunch of laws that would do nothing to stop these murders,¡± Mr. Cruz said. ¡°But what they propose ? not only does it not reduce crime, it makes it worse.¡± The renewed focus on gun control is expected to cast attention back on Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, who opposes dismantling the legislative filibuster but has long labored ? fruitlessly ? to pass a bipartisan gun control proposal.  Following the 2012 shooting massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., Mr. Manchin brokered a deal with Senator Pat Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, to close legal loopholes that allow people who purchase firearms at gun shows or on the internet to avoid background checks, but proponents were unable to pick up enough support to pass it. Mr. Manchin told CQ Roll Call earlier this month that he opposed the House-passed universal background check bill, citing its provision requiring checks for sales between private citizens, but said he was interested in reviving the Manchin-Toomey legislation.

Trump misleadingly and wrongly described his own record, the events of Jan. 6, 2021, his handling of classified documents, foreign policy and the economy. By Linda Qiu Reporting from Washington Former President Donald J. Trump almost immediately began citing a litany of falsehoods Wednesday night during a town hall-style meeting in New Hampshire broadcast on CNN. After incorrectly characterizing the 2020 presidential election as ¡°rigged,¡± Mr. Trump repeated a number of other falsehoods that have become staples of his political messaging. He misleadingly and wrongly described his record, the events of Jan. 6, 2021, his handling of classified documents, foreign policy, immigration policy, the economy and a woman whom a jury found he sexually abused. Here¡¯s a fact check of some of his claims. What WAS Said ¡°We got 12 million more votes than we had ? as you know ? in 2016.¡± This is misleading. Mr. Trump received 74 million votes in the 2020 presidential election, 12 million more than he received in the 2016 election. But, of course, President Biden received even more votes in 2020: 81 million. Mr. Trump then repeated his lie that the 2020 election was rigged. As the CNN moderator Kaitlan Collins noted, no evidence has surfaced to support his false claims of an army of people voting multiple times, dead people voting and missing ballots. What WAS Said ¡°I offered them 10,000 soldiers. I said it could be 10, it could be more, but I offered them specifically 10,000 soldiers.¡± This is false. Mr. Trump was referring to the events of Jan. 6, 2021, when his loyalists stormed the Capitol in a bid to stop the certification of Mr. Biden¡¯s election victory. There is no evidence that Mr. Trump ever made a request for 10,000 National Guard troops or that the speaker of the House at the time, Nancy Pelosi, rejected such a demand. The speaker does not control the National Guard. Mr. Trump also claimed that the acting defense secretary at the time, Christopher C. Miller, backed up his account. Vanity Fair reported in 2021 that Mr. Trump had floated the 10,000 figure to Mr. Miller the night of Jan. 5. But in 2022, Mr. Miller told a House committee investigating the events of Jan. 6 that he was ¡°never given any direction or order or knew of any plans of that nature.¡± There is no record of Mr. Trump making such a request either. The Pentagon¡¯s timeline of events leading up to the riot notes that the Defense Department reviewed a plan to activate 340 members of the District of Columbia¡¯s National Guard, ¡°if asked.¡± But the timeline makes no mention of a request for 10,000 troops by Mr. Trump. Nor did a Pentagon inspector general report on the breach, which instead referred to suggestions by Mr. Trump that his rally on Jan. 6 had been conducted safely. A Pentagon spokesman also told The Washington Post that it had ¡°no record of such an order being given.¡± What WAS Said Former Vice President Mike Pence ¡°should have put the votes back to the state legislatures, and I think we would have had a different outcome.¡± This is false. The vice president does not have the power or legal authority to alter the presidential election, as Mr. Pence has repeatedly and correctly noted. A House committee investigating the attack on the Capitol found that John Eastman, a conservative lawyer who was the chief architect of Mr. Trump¡¯s attempts to overturn the 2020 election, had admitted to Mr. Trump two days before Jan. 6 that his plan to have Mr. Pence to halt the vote certification process was illegal. What WAS Said ¡°This woman, I don¡¯t know her. I never met her. I have no idea who she is.¡± This is false. A Manhattan jury on Tuesday found that Mr. Trump had sexually abused and defamed E. Jean Carroll, a writer. Regardless of whether Mr. Trump remembers meeting Ms. Carroll, there is clear evidence that the two have met: a black-and-white photo of the two along with their spouses at the time. What WAS Said ¡°We created the greatest economy in history. A big part of that economy was I got you the biggest tax cuts in the history of our country, bigger than the Reagan cuts.¡± This is false. Average growth, even before the coronavirus pandemic battered the economy, was lower under Mr. Trump than under Presidents Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan. Nor were the tax cuts Mr. Trump signed into law in 2017 the ¡°biggest¡± ever. According to a report from the Treasury Department, the 1981 Reagan tax cut is the largest as a percentage of the economy (2.9 percent of gross domestic product) and by the reduction in federal revenue (a 13.3 percent decrease). The Obama tax cut in 2012 amounted to the largest cut in inflation-adjusted dollars: $321 billion a year. By comparison, Mr. Trump¡¯s 2017 tax cut was about $150 billion annually and amounted to about 0.9 percent of gross domestic product. Mr. Trump also claimed to have presided over ¡°zero¡± inflation. Although some months had zero inflation or even price declines as the coronavirus pandemic hit, the Consumer Price Index increased 1.2 percent overall in 2020, the last full year he was in office, and had risen at a 1.4 percent annual rate in January 2021, his last month as president. What WAS Said ¡°If you look at Chicago, Chicago has the single toughest gun policies in the nation. They are so tough you can¡¯t breathe, New York, too, and other places also. All those places are the worst and most dangerous places so that¡¯s not the answer.¡± This is misleading. Opponents of firearm restrictions frequently cite Chicago as a case study of how tough gun laws do little to prevent homicides. This argument, however, relies on faulty assumptions about the city¡¯s gun laws and gun violence. There were more gun murders in Chicago than in any other city in the United States in 2020, fueling the perception that it is the gun violence capital of the country. But Chicago is also the third-largest city in the country. Adjusted by population, the gun homicide rate was 25.2 per 100,000, the 26th highest in the country in 2020, according to data compiled by the gun-control group Everytown for Gun Safety. The three cities with the highest gun homicide rates ? Jackson, Miss., Gary, Ind., and St. Louis ? had rates double that of Chicago¡¯s. All are in states with more permissive gun laws than Illinois. Chicago¡¯s reputation for having the strictest gun control measures in the country is outdated. The Supreme Court nullified the city¡¯s handgun ban in 2010. An appeals court also struck down a ban on carrying concealed weapons in Illinois in 2012, and the state began allowing possession of concealed guns in 2013, as part of the court decision. Today, Illinois has tougher restrictions than most states, but it does not lead the pack, ranking No. 7 in Everytown¡¯s assessment of the strength of state gun control laws, and No. 8 in a report card released by the Giffords Law Center, another gun control group. Conversely, the state ranked No. 41 in an assessment on gun rights from the libertarian Cato Institute. Gun control proponents have also argued that the patchwork nature of gun laws in the country makes it difficult for a state like Illinois with tough restrictions on the books to enforce those in practice. A 2017 study commissioned by the City of Chicago found, for example, that 60 percent of guns used in crimes and recovered in Chicago came from out of state, with neighboring Indiana as the primary source. What WAS Said ¡°I built the wall. I built hundreds of miles of wall and I finished it.¡± This is false. The Trump administration constructed 453 miles of border wall over four years, and a vast majority of the new barriers reinforced or replaced existing structures. Of that, about 47 miles were new primary barriers. The United States¡¯ southwestern border with Mexico is over 1,900 miles, and during his campaign, Mr. Trump had vowed to build a wall across the entire border and make Mexico pay for it. Mexico did not pay for the barriers that had been constructed. What WAS Said ¡°I got with NATO ? I got them to put up hundreds of millions of dollars that they weren¡¯t paying under Obama and Bush and all these other presidents.¡± This is misleading. Under guidelines for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, members agreed to commit a minimum of 2 percent of G.D.P. on their own defense, but few nations actually do so. They do not ¡°pay¡± the alliance directly. NATO members agreed that nations currently not meeting the 2 percent goal would do so in the next decade, and that nations meeting it would continue to do so ? but they made this pledge in September 2014, years before Mr. Trump became president. ¡°And the reason for this is not Donald Trump ? it¡¯s Vladimir Putin, Russia¡¯s actions in Crimea and aggressive stance,¡± said Ivo H. Daalder, a NATO ambassador under President Barack Obama, previously told The New York Times. What WAS Said ¡°You know who else took them? Obama took them.¡± This is false. Mr. Trump has repeatedly and wrongly compared his handling of classified documents with that of his predecessor. After his presidency, Mr. Trump took a trove of classified documents ? including some marked top secret ? to Mar-a-Lago, his Florida estate. In contrast, the National Archives and Records Administration, which preserves and maintains records after a president leaves office, has said in a statement that Mr. Obama turned over his documents, classified and unclassified, as required by law. The agency has also said it is not aware of any missing boxes of presidential records from the Obama administration. Mr. Trump then falsely claimed that Mr. Biden ¡°took more than anybody,¡± about 1,800 boxes. But that number refers to a collection of documents Mr. Biden had donated to the University of Delaware in 2012 from his tenure as a senator representing the state from 1973 to 2009. Unlike presidential documents, which must be released to the National Archives once a president leaves office, documents from members of Congress are not covered by the Presidential Records Act. It is not uncommon for senators and representatives to give such items to research or historical facilities. The university agreed not to give the public access to Mr. Biden¡¯s documents from his time as senator until two years after he retired from public life. But the F.B.I. did search the collection in February as part of a special counsel investigation and in cooperation with Mr. Biden¡¯s legal team. The Times reported at the time that the material was still being analyzed but did not appear to contain any classified documents. What WAS Said ¡°I didn¡¯t ask him to find anything. If this call was bad ? I said you owe me votes because the election was rigged. That election was rigged.¡± This is false. In a taped January 2021 call, Mr. Trump said the words ¡°find 11,780 votes¡± as he pressured Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger of Georgia to overturn election results in his state. ¡°All I want to do is this,¡± he said in the call. ¡°I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have because we won the state.¡± Mr. Trump also accused Mr. Raffensperger of ¡°not reporting¡± corrupt ballots and ballot shredding (there is no evidence that this happened in Georgia), and told him that ¡°that¡¯s a criminal offense.¡± Linda Qiu is a fact-check reporter, based in Washington.

By Catie Edmondson WASHINGTON ? Hours after the worst school shooting in a decade took place in his home state, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas acknowledged that there were ¡°way too many of these horrific mass murders¡± and suggested a possible solution: putting armed law enforcement on campuses. Then Mr. Cruz, a Republican, quickly turned to blame Democrats and the news media for politicizing the issue. ¡°If you look to the past, we know what is effective, and it is targeting the felons and fugitives and the bad guys,¡± Mr. Cruz told reporters at the Capitol on Tuesday evening. ¡°But as sure as night follows day, you can bet there are going to be Democrat politicians looking to advance their own political agenda, rather than to work to stop this kind of horrific violence and to keep everyone safe.¡± In the aftermath of Tuesday¡¯s school massacre in Uvalde, Texas, where an 18-year-old gunman killed 19 children and two teachers, Mr. Cruz remained unapologetic in his broad opposition to gun control measures. He reverted to a script that condemns Democrats for trying to use the issue for partisan advantage and argued that lawmakers should narrowly target the criminals who try to purchase firearms illegally. Before the shooting, Mr. Cruz, who received an A+ rating from the National Rifle Association during his 2018 re-election bid, was scheduled to address the organization on Friday at its convention in Houston. A spokeswoman for Mr. Cruz did not respond when asked if he still planned to attend the gathering. Mr. Cruz¡¯s unwavering position on guns reflects the entrenched opposition in his party to virtually any proposal that seeks to limit access to firearms. That firm stance has for years thwarted Democratic efforts to enact gun safety measures, even as the death toll from mass shootings in the United States has grown anew. The immediate reaction of Mr. Cruz and other Republican lawmakers after the Uvalde shooting suggested that basic political dynamic remained unchanged. ¡°We don¡¯t want to take away the rights of law-abiding citizens,¡± Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, the No. 3 Republican, said on Wednesday when asked if Republicans were interested in passing any gun control measures in the aftermath of the shooting. During his time in the Senate, Mr. Cruz has insisted that he is trying to focus his attention on legislative measures that would narrowly target criminals and protect the rights of citizens who follow the law. In 2013, he introduced legislation with Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, that would have incentivized states through grants to submit mental health records to the database that is used to check gun buyers¡¯ backgrounds, known as the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. It also would have increased the maximum sentences for people found guilty of straw purchases and gun trafficking. But Mr. Cruz, Texas¡¯ junior senator, has almost uniformly opposed other measures aimed at combating gun violence. During the Trump administration, when Texas¡¯ senior senator, John Cornyn, a Republican, successfully pushed to pass legislation requiring federal agencies and states to do a better job of reporting criminal offenses to the national background?check system, Mr. Cruz kept his distance from the effort. Gun control became a central issue in Mr. Cruz¡¯s re-election campaign in 2018, when the Texas Republican fended off a challenge from his Democratic opponent, Beto O¡¯Rourke, who was a House member at the time. In that race, Mr. Cruz focused attention on Mr. O¡¯Rourke¡¯s support for a ban on purchases of assault weapons, warning voters that the Democrat wanted to ¡°take our guns.¡± By contrast, months after the 2012 shooting?at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., Mr. Cruz voted against a measure prohibiting the sale of assault weapons. ¡°Assault weapons ban fails,¡± he wrote on Twitter at the time. ¡°#2ndAmendment prevails #Protect2A.¡± In 2019, when Mr. Cruz was asked about expanding background checks for all firearms sales over the internet and at gun shows, he warned that such a move would have a dispiriting effect on Republican voters. ¡°If Republicans abandon the Second Amendment and demoralize millions of Americans who care deeply about Second Amendment rights, that could go a long way to electing a President Elizabeth Warren,¡± Mr. Cruz said, referring to the Democratic senator from Massachusetts, who was seeking the Democratic presidential nomination at the time. Last year, after a mass shooting at a grocery store in Boulder, Colo., that killed 10 people, Mr. Cruz renewed his complaints that Democrats were seeking to politicize the issue. ¡°Every time there¡¯s a shooting, we play this ridiculous theater where this committee gets together and proposes a bunch of laws that would do nothing to stop these murders,¡± Mr. Cruz said from the dais of the Senate Judiciary Committee. ¡°But what they propose ? not only does it not reduce crime, it makes it worse.¡± Mr. Cruz¡¯s comments on Tuesday night ? when he suggested the best way to prevent school shootings was to keep armed guards on campuses ? drew a new round of criticism from Democrats infuriated with his stance. Representative Ruben Gallego, Democrat of Arizona, called him a ¡°baby killer¡± in an expletive-laden post on Twitter. Representative Joaquin Castro, Democrat of Texas, said he did not know ¡°how Greg Abbott and Ted Cruz can show their face in Uvalde, Texas, this week.¡± ¡°Ted Cruz is just a slave to the gun lobby,¡± Mr. Castro said. ¡°And he won¡¯t do anything to solve this problem and has just made matters worse.¡± On Wednesday, Mr. Cruz had another testy interaction with Mr. O¡¯Rourke. Mr. O¡¯Rourke is now running for governor against Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican seeking re-election this year. The Democrat interrupted a news conference hosted by Mr. Abbott and accused Republicans of ¡°doing nothing¡± to address gun violence. Mr. Cruz was also on hand. ¡°Sit down,¡± the senator snapped at his former opponent. Catie Edmondson is a reporter in the Washington bureau, covering Congress.

By Annie Karni WASHINGTON ? Kimberly Rubio, whose 10-year-old daughter Lexi was killed during the mass shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, pleaded with members of Congress on Wednesday to enact new gun control laws, using her own fresh pain to demand action. ¡°We seek a ban on assault rifles and high-capacity magazines,¡± Ms. Rubio said, her voice shaking after recounting the last time she saw her daughter and the panicked moments before she learned that Lexi was dead. ¡°We understand for some reason, to some people ? to people with money, to people who fund political campaigns ? that guns are more important than children.¡± ¡°So at this moment, we ask for progress.¡± Ms. Rubio¡¯s emotional entreaty, delivered as her husband sat silently weeping beside her, came during a hearing on gun control legislation that is stalled on Capitol Hill amid Republican opposition, and as negotiators in the Senate grasp for a bipartisan deal that could break the stalemate. Lexi¡¯s parents were joined by Dr. Roy Guerrero, the sole pediatrician in the small town of Uvalde and an alumnus of Robb Elementary, who testified in tragically graphic detail about what the AR-15 used in the massacre had done to the bodies of fourth graders. Testifying in person on Capitol Hill, he railed against lawmakers who have failed to act in the face of a rising tide of gun violence in America. ¡°We¡¯re bleeding out,¡± he told the committee, ¡°and you are not there.¡± Dr. Guerrero recalled seeing two children ¡°whose bodies had been so pulverized by the bullets fired at them over and over again, whose flesh had been so ripped apart, that the only clue as to their identities were the blood-spattered cartoon clothes still clinging to them.¡± Miah Cerrillo, a fourth-grader who survived the carnage at Robb by covering herself in a classmate¡¯s blood and pretending to be dead, shared her ordeal in a prerecorded video, too traumatized to appear in person. ¡°He shot my friend that was next to me,¡± she said of the gunman who slaughtered 19 students and two teachers at her school, speaking quietly and with little evident emotion. ¡°And I thought he would come back to the room.¡± Miah¡¯s father, who appeared at the hearing in person on his daughter¡¯s behalf, left the hearing room in tears. The emotional testimony unfolded hours before the House was scheduled to vote on a package of gun control measures, including legislation that would prohibit the sale of semiautomatic rifles to people under the age of 21 and ban the sale of magazines that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition. The bills are all but certain to go nowhere in the evenly divided Senate, where solid Republican opposition means that they cannot draw the 60 votes needed to break through a filibuster. The hope among Democrats was that the first-person stories from witnesses still processing the trauma of gun violence would underscore to the public and to lawmakers all that is at stake, increasing pressure on Republicans who oppose gun control measures to do something. ¡°No civilian needs an assault rifle, and the Second Amendment does not protect the right to own a weapon of war,¡± said Representative Carolyn Maloney, Democrat of New York and the chairman of the committee. ¡°It¡¯s time that we ban assault rifles from our streets and homes.¡± Zeneta Everhart, whose son Zaire was injured during the racist gun attack in Buffalo, N.Y., 10 days before the Uvalde tragedy, said lawmakers who continued to do nothing in the face of mass shootings should be voted out of office. ¡°Let me paint a picture for you: My son Zaire has a hole in the right side of his neck, two on his back and another on his left leg, caused by an exploding bullet from an AR-15,¡± she said. ¡°I want you to picture that exact scenario for one of your children. This should not be your story or mine.¡± But the second half of the hearing, during which lawmakers questioned expert witnesses, appeared disconnected from the wrenching testimonials delivered by grieving parents and mass shooting survivors. The Republicans in the room appeared unmoved by the testimonials and demands for action, retreating to their political corners, where they reiterated their previously held positions on guns. ¡°Evil deeds do not transcend constitutional rights,¡± says Representative Andrew Clyde, Republican of Georgia, arguing that gun-free school zone signs were part of the problem and that the solution was hardening schools. Representative James Comer of Kentucky, the panel¡¯s top Republican, warned in an opening statement that ¡°knee-jerk reactions,¡± such as proposals for stronger gun laws, in the face of gun violence were not the answer. Instead, he said the problem was those who are soft on crime and support defunding the police. Annie Karni is a congressional correspondent. She was previously a White House correspondent.

https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/29/us/highland-park-shooting-victims-lawsuit.html?searchResultPosition=101,2022-09-29,Victims of Highland Park Shooting Sue Gun Maker and Retailers,"Lawsuits filed Tuesday in Lake County, Ill., argue that Smith & Wesson, the manufacturer of the rifle used in the Fourth of July attack, ¡°deceptively and unfairly¡± marketed its weapons. By Christine Hauser and Livia Albeck-Ripka Survivors and families of victims of the Fourth of July shooting in Highland Park, Ill., have filed lawsuits against Smith & Wesson, citing its marketing of the semiautomatic rifle used in the attack. The plaintiffs also sued two gun stores, the accused gunman and his father. As mass shootings have become a painfully common occurrence and most federal gun control efforts have failed, suing gun manufacturers over their marketing is a novel legal tactic that plaintiffs have begun using as a way around a federal law protecting gun companies from litigation. Seven people were killed and more than 30 people were injured, ranging in age from 8 to 85, in the Highland Park shooting, which took place during a parade in the city, about 25 miles north of downtown Chicago. Robert E. Crimo III, who was 21 at the time, was indicted in July on 21 counts of first-degree murder, or three counts for each fatality, and multiple counts of attempted murder and aggravated battery with a firearm, according to the Lake County State¡¯s Attorney¡¯s Office. The lawsuits were announced on Wednesday by representatives of three of the people who were killed, as well as several others who were wounded or traumatized. The suits also name Bud¡¯s Gun Shop, Red Dot Arms, Mr. Crimo and his father, Robert Crimo Jr., as defendants. The suits were filed Tuesday in the Circuit Court of the 19th Judicial Circuit in Lake County, and are seeking a jury trial. Gunmakers are protected from being held liable for mass shootings by a federal shield law, the 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. But families of those killed in the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting argued that marketing of the weapon by Remington, the gunmaker, violated a state consumer protection law. In February, Remington agreed to pay $73 million to families of nine Sandy Hook shooting victims over the AR-15-style rifle used in the 2012 massacre, believed to be the largest such settlement by a gun manufacturer. The Highland Park lawsuits are employing a similar tactic to those used in the Remington case. The filings allege that Mr. Crimo, using a Smith & Wesson, ¡°was able to act out his violent fantasy ??like so many disturbed and hate-filled young men before him.¡± They argue that the shooting played out in an entirely foreseeable way, ¡°with extreme and limitless power,¡± just as the gun manufacturer had advertised. Smith & Wesson¡¯s marketing of the semiautomatic rifle, they add, misleadingly implied a link between its military and police line of rifles and the U.S. military, especially to appeal to individuals like Mr. Crimo. The suits also argue that two gun stores ? Bud¡¯s Gun Shop and Red Dot Arms ? negligently and illegally sold the murder weapon to Mr. Crimo in violation of an assault weapons ban in Highwood and Highland Park, Ill. According to the complaints, Mr. Crimo¡¯s father also acted negligently by sponsoring his son¡¯s firearm application when he was just 19, and shortly after he had attempted suicide and had threatened to kill everyone in his house. Suing the parent of an alleged gunman is another rare legal tactic that the Highland Park plaintiffs are using. In a criminal case, an Oakland County, Mich., prosecutor filed involuntary manslaughter charges in December against the parents of the suspect in last year¡¯s shooting at Oxford High School in suburban Detroit. ¡°The July 4th mass shooting in Highland Park wasn¡¯t just an act of one troubled young man,¡± Alla Lefkowitz, the senior director of affirmative litigation at Everytown Law, one of the firms representing the plaintiffs, said in a statement released Wednesday. She added, ¡°He used a gun that was deceptively and unfairly marketed to him by Smith & Wesson, illegally sold to him by Bud¡¯s Gun Shop and Red Dot Arms, and negligently put in his hands by his father.¡± Smith & Wesson and Bud¡¯s Gun Shop did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Thursday. A representative from Red Dot Arms, reached by phone Thursday, said the company had no comment on the suits. Lorena Rebollar Sedano, who was shot in the attack, said in a statement that her life was irrevocably changed by the Fourth of July attack. ¡°Because of the marketing and advertising of these kinds of weapons, our lives will not be the same,¡± Ms. Sedano added. ¡°That is why we demand justice so that this person pays and all those responsible pay for what they did.¡± Christine Hauser is a reporter, covering national and foreign news.

Schmidt Glenn Thrush reported from Washington, and Michael S. Schmidt from New York. To Hunter Biden¡¯s father, the Supreme Court decision last June that expanded Second Amendment rights is a travesty for gun control. But to Hunter Biden¡¯s lawyers, it has been an opening. In the months after the court¡¯s landmark ruling that gave people a broad right to carry guns outside the home, Mr. Biden¡¯s lawyers told Justice Department prosecutors ? who were investigating whether to charge him in connection with a gun purchase ? that a prosecution of him would likely be ruled moot, according to two people briefed on the matter. While it is not uncommon for defense lawyers to point to shifting precedents to stave off prosecution, the circumstances of this argument, like so many elements of the Hunter Biden saga, are striking: A president¡¯s son is invoking a court decision his father has described as an affront to ¡°common sense and the Constitution¡± ? and staking that claim on a majority opinion written by Justice Clarence Thomas, a vigorous supporter of gun rights whom many Democrats see as having helped enable the gun lobby. The U.S. attorney in Delaware, David C. Weiss, is wrapping up his investigation into Hunter Biden as uncertainty mounts about the legality of many gun laws after the court¡¯s landmark ruling last summer, which has led to a wide-ranging assault on existing firearms laws. Mr. Biden is under investigation for several potential offenses, including whether he had lied on a federal firearms application in 2018 when asked if he was addicted to drugs. His lawyers, including the white-collar defense lawyer Christopher Clark, have argued that any charge against him would likely be thrown out after federal appeals courts rule on two major challenges that cite the Supreme Court decision as precedent. It is unclear if Mr. Weiss is receptive to that suggestion. A spokeswoman for Mr. Weiss did not immediately respond to a request for comment. One case the Hunter Biden team has cited is a challenge to the criteria used in the federal firearms background check system, which relies on a ubiquitous application known as a 4473 form, pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, which includes Delaware. In that case, Bryan David Range, a Pennsylvania man who was denied a gun permit over a decades-old misdemeanor, is asking to be granted gun ownership based, in part, on Justice Thomas¡¯s opinion. That case, argued in February, is likely to be decided over the next several months. Hunter Biden¡¯s lawyers have relied on the argument as they have asserted that the long-running Justice Department investigation, which has examined an array of matters, including his failure to file federal income taxes, should end with no charges. In recent years, the investigation expanded to include scrutiny of his purchase of a handgun in 2018, and his false response of ¡°no¡± when asked whether he was an ¡°unlawful user¡± of drugs. At the time, Mr. Biden was struggling to remain sober. But such federal prosecutions are relatively rare, and seldom pursued as stand-alone charges. And officials at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives responsible for reviewing Mr. Biden¡¯s file were skeptical of bringing charges against him, especially considering that he had sought treatment and had no prior criminal history, according to another person with knowledge of the situation. There have been calls in recent years to alter or remove the drug question from the firearms application, especially when it comes to marijuana, but Congress has not amended federal firearms or drug laws, and federal officials have not weakened their regulations. On Tuesday, the A.T.F. held firm on that position, warning cannabis users in Minnesota they were barred from buying guns or ammunition despite the easing of state restrictions. The case before the Third Circuit ? which has drawn national attention ? challenges the government¡¯s right to block people convicted of nonviolent crimes or other ¡°nonserious¡± violations from owning a firearm. (Mr. Range¡¯s offense was misrepresenting his income to obtain food stamps.) At the center of the case, as in the Hunter Biden investigation, is the 4473 form, ¡°a gotcha trap intended to deny people their Second Amendment rights,¡± said Michael P. Gottlieb, Mr. Range¡¯s lawyer. ¡°This is a case of national importance,¡± he said. ¡°Whatever the Third Circuit decides, I see this going all the way up to the Supreme Court.¡± Justice Department lawyers have said that nonviolent offenses indicate a person¡¯s general ¡°disrespect for rule of law¡± and should bar them from gun ownership. But the Supreme Court¡¯s ruling has spawned dozens of lawsuits across the country, including some that challenge the federal government¡¯s right to deny firearms to people who are addicted to drugs. The most significant decision to date came in February when a three-judge appeals panel in New Orleans struck down part of a federal law that banned people under domestic violence restraining orders from owning firearms. Most of the cases are based on a broad standard established in Justice Thomas¡¯s majority opinion, which asked that gun laws be ¡°consistent with this nation¡¯s historical tradition of firearm regulation.¡± Another case Mr. Biden¡¯s team has cited is a February ruling from a Federal District Court in Oklahoma that struck down parts of a federal law prohibiting marijuana users from owning firearms. The Justice Department is expected to appeal the decision. Glenn Thrush covers the Department of Justice.

On Tuesday, liberal activists expressed outrage at a group of male New Hampshire legislators who wore pearl necklaces at a committee hearing. Shannon Watts, the founder of a gun control group, Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, posted an image of the lawmakers, all Republicans, on Twitter and accused them of mocking her group¡¯s volunteers and others who were testifying. Male New Hampshire lawmakers on the hearing committee wearing pearls to mock @MomsDemand volunteers and gun safety advocates. #NHPolitics pic.twitter.com/rc1S3Bj9lG The intended message of the pearls wasn¡¯t entirely clear, though one interpretation was that the lawmakers were trying to paint members of the group as ¡°pearl clutchers¡± ? suggesting that they were being overly sensitive. People responding to the tweet attacked the men pictured, calling them bullies and their behavior malicious and cruel. Two Democratic presidential hopefuls, Senators Cory Booker and Kamala Harris, weighed in on Twitter in support of Moms Demand Action, which is an arm of Everytown For Gun Safety, the gun control group financed by Michael Bloomberg. ¡°These moms are fighting to confront gun violence and protect our children,¡± Ms. Harris said. ¡°They don¡¯t deserve to be mocked.¡± But a different narrative soon emerged: Kimberly Morin, the president of a gun rights group that also attended the hearing, told The New Hampshire Union Leader that her group had distributed the pearls. The hearing was over a proposed ¡°red flag¡± bill, which would allow courts to temporarily take away guns from people found to be an immediate risk to themselves or others. In an interview on Wednesday, Ms. Morin said the pearls were not meant to mock anyone, but had for years been a symbol for her group, the Women¡¯s Defense League of New Hampshire, which offers firearms training to women as well as advocating gun rights. ¡°She¡¯s lying,¡± Ms. Morin said of Ms. Watts, the founder of Moms Demand Action. ¡°That¡¯s my comment ? she¡¯s lying.¡± For her part, Ms. Watts said Ms. Morin¡¯s group was backing away from the necklaces¡¯ original intent. ¡°It started out meant to mock Moms Demand Action volunteers,¡± she insisted. Ms. Morin traced the origin of the symbolic pearls to 2015. After a hearing that year on a bill to allow people to carry concealed guns without a permit, an anonymous Moms Demand Action volunteer was quoted as saying that many potential opponents of the bill didn¡¯t testify because they were intimidated, Ms. Morin said. ¡°People really don¡¯t like to come and stand in front of a ¡®firing squad¡¯ ? a group of people with guns,¡± the volunteer told WMUR, a local television station. Ms. Morin said her group found the statement absurd. That day, some in her group were dressed in business suits ? and as it happened, pearls ? hardly the attire of a ¡°firing squad.¡± It was that sequence of events that led the group to make pearls their signature, she said. (The bill was ultimately signed by Gov. Chris Sununu in 2017 at a ceremony rife with pearl necklaces.) New Hampshire has among the least restrictive gun laws in the country, and support for gun rights is strong. Democrats took control of both chambers of the legislature in November and are now pushing a package of bills aimed at setting limits on guns, including bills requiring background checks for commercial gun purchases, creating a waiting period between the purchase and delivery of a gun, and allowing school districts to create gun-free zones. The bills face considerable odds, given that Mr. Sununu, a Republican, has expressed opposition to any changes to the state¡¯s gun laws, a position his spokesman reiterated on Wednesday.

Earlier in the day, the Supreme Court struck down New York¡¯s gun law, likely limiting the ability of other state and local governments to restrict guns outside the home.  Annie Karni and Emily Cochrane WASHINGTON ? The Senate approved bipartisan legislation on Thursday aimed at keeping firearms out of the hands of dangerous people, after a small group of Republicans joined Democrats to break through their party¡¯s longstanding blockade of gun safety measures and shatter nearly three decades of congressional paralysis on toughening the nation¡¯s gun laws. Spurred to action by a mass shooting that killed 19 children and two teachers at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, the Senate passed the measure 65 to 33, with 15 Republicans, including Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader, breaking ranks to side with Democrats in support of the measure. Two Republican senators were absent. It would enhance background checks for prospective gun buyers ages 18 to 21, requiring for the first time that juvenile records, including mental health records beginning at age 16, be vetted for potentially disqualifying material. The bill would provide incentives for states to pass ¡°red flag¡± laws that allow guns to be temporarily confiscated from people deemed by a judge to be too dangerous to possess them. And it would tighten a federal ban on domestic abusers buying firearms, and strengthen laws against straw purchasing and trafficking of guns. It also includes hundreds of millions of dollars in funding for mental health programs and to beef up security in schools. ¡°This is not a cure-all for all the ways gun violence affects our nation, but it is a long overdue step in the right direction,¡± Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the majority leader, said on the Senate floor. ¡°It¡¯s significant ? it¡¯s going to save lives.¡± Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California announced on Thursday night that the House would move to take up the measure on Friday morning. White House officials have said President Biden would sign it, calling the bill ¡°one of the most significant steps Congress has taken to reduce gun violence in decades.¡± The bipartisan breakthrough came on the same day that the Supreme Court struck down a New York law that placed strict limits on carrying guns outside the home, reflecting a stark divergence between the conservative-leaning court and the Democratic-controlled Congress on one of the most politically intractable issues in the country. The vote tally also underscored how deeply polarizing the issue remains, and how fleeting the spirit of compromise around guns may be. Most Republicans opposed the bill, and most of those backing it will not face voters this year, suggesting that the measure was less an opening for a new era of bipartisan consensus on gun violence than a rare moment of agreement that may soon give way to more gridlock, particularly if Republicans win control of Congress this fall. Still, a small group of Democrats and Republicans seized on the outrage that followed the massacre in Uvalde almost exactly one month ago and a racist mass shooting in Buffalo days before that to forge a modest compromise that could succeed where earlier attempts had repeatedly failed. Mr. McConnell praised Democrats for being ¡°willing to give up their wish list¡± and accept less than they have insisted on in past efforts at revamping gun laws. He also conceded that he and other Republicans saw a clear political advantage in supporting the legislation in a midterm election year in which their path to winning control of Congress runs through the suburbs, where their party¡¯s hard-right lurch has alienated many voters. ¡°It¡¯s no secret that we¡¯ve lost ground in suburban areas,¡± Mr. McConnell told reporters on Thursday night. ¡°I hope it will be viewed favorably by voters in the suburbs we need to regain to be in the majority next year.¡± The compromise, the product of an intense round of talks between a small group of Democrats and Republicans, omits many of the sweeping gun control measures that Democrats and activists have long called for. Toiling to keep Republicans on board, Democrats left out their marquee gun control proposals, including a House-passed measure that would prohibit the sale of semiautomatic rifles to people younger than 21, a ban on the sale of high-capacity magazines and a federal red flag law. They also agreed that the enhanced background checks for younger buyers would expire after a decade, just as the assault weapons ban did in 2004, leaving future Congresses to haggle anew about whether to extend it. But it included substantial breakthroughs beyond what Democrats had initially thought possible when they set out to find a modest deal that could, at the very least, show that Congress was capable of responding to national crisis. ¡°I¡¯ve never seen families and kids and parents as scared as they were after Uvalde,¡± Senator Christopher S. Murphy of Connecticut, the lead Democratic negotiator, said on Thursday. They were scared for their children¡¯s safety, he said, ¡°but they were also scared that their government was so fundamentally broken that it couldn¡¯t step up and address the one thing that matters most to anybody in this country ? the safety of our kids.¡± Mr. Murphy said that while the legislation fell short of everything Democrats would like to pass, it provided ¡°an answer that allows us to tell families all across this country that the era of inaction is over.¡± The bill would set aside $750 million in federal grant funding to help states implement red flag laws and for other crisis intervention programs, including mental health courts. In another change long sought by activists against domestic violence, it would include serious current or recent dating partners in a federal law that bars domestic abusers from being able to purchase a firearm, closing what has become known as the boyfriend loophole. The ban currently applies only to people who have been married to, have been living with or have a child with a victim. The legislation would set aside millions of dollars, largely in grants, to address mental health in schools and communities, including $150 million for the national suicide hotline. It also would provide $300 million for school safety programs, including bolstering security and funding school resource officers. Besides Mr. McConnell, the Republican support came from centrists, longtime veterans of previous failed negotiations, and notably, lawmakers just a couple of years into their latest term. Just two of the 15 Republicans, Senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Todd Young of Indiana, are facing voters in November, and four are retiring. In trying to make their case to Republicans, Mr. McConnell and Senator John Cornyn of Texas, his handpicked emissary to the talks, conducted a poll of 1,000 gun-owning households across the country and found that most supported the key elements. A solid majority backed increasing federal funding for states to maintain or implement red flag laws, and more than 80 percent supported closing the boyfriend loophole and allowing law enforcement to have more time to examine juvenile and mental health records. That was not enough for most Senate Republicans, however, who argued that the measure would infringe upon the rights of gun owners.  ¡°I¡¯m angry that these horrific crimes keep happening, but I¡¯m also angry that this august chamber plays political games,¡± said Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, who teamed with Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, the No. 3 Republican, in an unsuccessful effort to strip out the gun-related measures and divert federal funds to mental health and school safety programs. ¡°Do something that will stop these crimes ? this bill ain¡¯t that, but it does have provisions that are troubling,¡± Mr. Cruz added. ¡°It does have provisions that satisfy the Democrat political priority to go after the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms of law-abiding citizens.¡± Mr. Cruz was echoing some of the criticism that the National Rifle Association heaped on the bill. The group said the legislation ¡°does little to truly address violent crime while opening the door to unnecessary burdens on the exercise of Second Amendment freedom by law-abiding gun owners.¡± Democratic proponents said the legislation¡¯s approval was possible only because the senators involved in the talks put aside their parties¡¯ orthodoxies to find a deal. ¡°Our bipartisan group of senators rejected the notion that legislating must be a zero-sum game with winners on one tally sheet and losers on the other,¡± said Senator Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, a key Democratic negotiator who took on the role of conduit to the Republican side during the negotiations. That meant Democrats had to tailor the bill¡¯s provisions to appeal to Republicans. For instance, they accepted a G.O.P. demand that closing the boyfriend loophole would not be implemented retroactively and that dating partners who commit a single misdemeanor offense can regain the ability to purchase a gun after five years if their records remain clean. ¡°The potential we have to save lives is worth any sort of concession we might have had to make during the negotiation,¡± Mr. Cornyn said in a speech on Thursday night, in which he thanked his colleagues for ignoring ¡°those who would spew disinformation and outright lies¡± about the measure. Afterward, several Democrats went up to Mr. Cornyn, who was heckled at a Republican gathering in Texas last week for last week for participating in the talks, to offer thanks and shake his hand. Democrats were hoping that the majority of Republicans who opposed the bill would look out of step with voters in the coming midterm elections. A recent Quinnipiac poll showed that 59 percent of Republicans and 76 percent of independents favored raising the minimum legal age to buy any gun to 21. And the vast majority, including Republican voters, supported at least some gun control measures, including enhanced background checks.

Fifteen Republican senators broke with their party to vote in favor of the bill, which passed 65 to 33. Only two of the Republicans who supported the bill are facing re-election this year, indicating how difficult it could be to advance similar compromises in the future. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Senate minority leader, expressed public support for the bill, calling it ¡°a common sense package of popular steps that will help make these horrifying incidents less likely while fully upholding the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens.¡± He has an A+ rating from the National Rifle Association, and his backing for the measure was seen as key to its passage. The other Republicans who supported the measure were: Roy Blunt of Missouri, chairman of the Senate Republican Policy Committee, is not as moderate as other Republican senators who voted yes, and previously was leaning no on the bill. Mr. Blunt has said that he would not seek re-election this year. He has an A rating from the National Rifle Association. Richard Burr of North Carolina signed onto the bipartisan gun framework released in early June. He is retiring from Congress at the end of the year and has an A+ rating from the N.R.A. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia was one of the surprise Republicans voting yes who previously deflected when asked where she stood on a gun control bill. Her home-state Democratic colleague, Joe Manchin, was an early and vocal supporter of a narrower bill during deliberations. Capito has an A rating from the N.R.A. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana worked on the bill¡¯s mental health component. He isn¡¯t up for election until 2026 and has an A rating from the N.R.A. Susan Collins of Maine was active in the negotiations over provisions for firearm trafficking, having introduced the Stop Illegal Trafficking in Firearms Act last year. ¡°There are mixed views back home, but by and large, the reaction has been positive because people realize that we¡¯re not hurting law-abiding gun owners,¡± she said during discussions. She has a B rating from the N.R.A. John Cornyn of Texas is a senior member of the Judiciary Committee who attempted to negotiate for expanded background checks last year and was booed at his state¡¯s party convention this past weekend. He was picked by McConnell as a leader for the deliberations over the bill framework as a Republican in a room of centrists who could make or break the bill. He has an A+ rating from the N.R.A.

Lindsey Graham of South Carolina co-sponsored a restraining order bill in 2018 with Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, to take away firearms from people who might pose a risk. He has an A rating from the N.R.A. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska is up for re-election in November as a moderate and has been rewarded by her constituency for her independent streak. ¡°If what we¡¯re doing is making things safer, without taking away people¡¯s Second Amendment rights, I think maybe we¡¯ve knit this just the way it needed to be,¡± she said. Ms. Murkowski has an A rating from the N.R.A. Robert Portman of Ohio is one of the 10 Republican senators who endorsed the bill framework in early June. He will retire this year and has an A rating from the N.R.A. Mitt Romney of Utah, along with Ms. Collins and Ms. Murkowski, is known as one of the Republican swing votes in the Senate.

Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania is one of two Republicans who supported expanded background check legislation in 2013. He is retiring from the Senate this year and has a C rating from the N.R.A. Todd Young of Indiana was a more surprising Republican yes vote. On Wednesday, he suggested that he was still examining the details of the bill. ¡°We didn¡¯t have a whole lot of time to review the text and solicit, from various stakeholders and experts, thoughts on it.

He played a key role in both negotiations and getting Republican support for this.  Emily Cochrane Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the top Republican negotiator on the bill, is speaking on the Senate floor. He¡¯s giving a passionate speech, thanking his colleagues for supporting the measure and for ignoring what he described as lies and disinformation about it.  Emily Cochrane Senator Ted Cruz¡¯s procedural vote failed, and it appears increasingly likely that the Senate will vote to pass the gun reform measure tonight.  Emily Cochrane The Senate is now voting on a procedural motion from Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, to stop passage of the gun reform compromise. The motion is expected to fail. However, as senators hope for an agreement to quickly pass the final product, it¡¯s also a good way to get those conversations going on the floor.   Quoctrung Bui,?Alicia Parlapiano and Margot Sanger-Katz If the key gun control proposals now being considered in Congress had been law since 1999, four gunmen younger than 21 would have been blocked from legally buying the rifles they used in mass shootings, according to a New York Times analysis referenced in a June 8 congressional hearing on gun violence. At least four other assailants would have been subject to a required background check, instead of slipping through a loophole. Ten might have been unable to steal their weapons because of efforts to require or encourage safer gun storage. And 20 might not have been allowed to legally purchase the large-capacity magazines that they used to upgrade their guns, helping them kill, on average, 16 people each. Taken together, those four measures might have changed the course of at least 35 mass shootings ? a third of such episodes in the United States since the massacre at Columbine High School in Colorado, a New York Times analysis has found. Those 35 shootings killed a combined 446 people. Representative Stephen Lynch, Democrat of Massachusetts, quoted from the Times report during the hearing.  Maggie Astor and Adam Liptak The Supreme Court¡¯s ruling in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen and its associated concurrences and dissents total 135 pages. We read them in full and collected some key excerpts. A copy of the full ruling is available here. The excerpts below omit internal citations. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote the opinion of the court, a 6-3 ruling in which he was joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Samuel A. Alito Jr., Amy Coney Barrett, Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh. The opinion held that ¡°the Second and Fourteenth Amendments protect an individual¡¯s right to carry a handgun for self-defense outside the home.¡± In concluding that New York had violated the Constitution by requiring people to show ¡°proper cause¡± when applying for a license to carry a handgun in public, Justice Thomas wrote (Pages 68-69): ¡°The constitutional right to bear arms in public for self-defense is not ¡®a second-class right, subject to an entirely different body of rules than the other Bill of Rights guarantees.¡¯ We know of no other constitutional right that an individual may exercise only after demonstrating to government officers some special need. That is not how the First Amendment works when it comes to unpopular speech or the free exercise of religion. It is not how the Sixth Amendment works when it comes to a defendant¡¯s right to confront the witnesses against him. And it is not how the Second Amendment works when it comes to public carry for self-defense. New York¡¯s proper-cause requirement violates the Fourteenth Amendment in that it prevents law-abiding citizens with ordinary self-defense needs from exercising their right to keep and bear arms.¡± Justice Thomas set out a new standard by which courts should evaluate gun restrictions (Page 14): ¡°To justify its regulation, the government may not simply posit that the regulation promotes an important interest. Rather, the government must demonstrate that the regulation is consistent with this nation¡¯s historical tradition of firearm regulation. Only if a firearm regulation is consistent with this nation¡¯s historical tradition may a court conclude that the individual¡¯s conduct falls outside the Second Amendment¡¯s ¡®unqualified command.¡¯¡± Justice Stephen G. Breyer, in a dissent joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor, focused on the toll of gun violence. He cited a long list of statistics and criticized the majority¡¯s conclusion that gun regulations had to be historically rooted in order to pass constitutional muster (Page 85-86): ¡°The court wrongly limits its analysis to focus nearly exclusively on history. It refuses to consider the government interests that justify a challenged gun regulation, regardless of how compelling those interests may be. The Constitution contains no such limitation, and neither do our precedents. ¡¦ The question before us concerns the extent to which the Second Amendment prevents democratically elected officials from enacting laws to address the serious problem of gun violence. And yet the court today purports to answer that question without discussing the nature or severity of that problem.¡± In a concurring opinion, Justice Alito suggested that the statistics Justice Breyer cited were irrelevant (Page 71): ¡°Why, for example, does the dissent think it is relevant to recount the mass shootings that have occurred in recent years? Does the dissent think that laws like New York¡¯s prevent or deter such atrocities? Will a person bent on carrying out a mass shooting be stopped if he knows that it is illegal to carry a handgun outside the home? And how does the dissent account for the fact that one of the mass shootings near the top of its list took place in Buffalo? The New York law at issue in this case obviously did not stop that perpetrator.¡± Justice Breyer responded by arguing that the complex facts of gun violence, and the differing circumstances in different parts of the country, made the issue best suited for resolution by state legislators, not by courts (Page 92): ¡°The primary difference between the court¡¯s view and mine is that I believe the Amendment allows states to take account of the serious problems posed by gun violence that I have just described. I fear that the court¡¯s interpretation ignores these significant dangers and leaves states without the ability to address them.¡± In an important concurring opinion ? one that appeared to limit the sweep of the majority opinion ? Justice Kavanaugh, joined by Chief Justice Roberts, wrote that some licensing requirements remained presumptively constitutional. In reference to ¡°shall-issue regimes¡± ? that is, states in which officials ¡°must issue concealed-carry licenses whenever applicants satisfy certain threshold requirements, without granting licensing officials discretion to deny licenses based on a perceived lack of need or suitability,¡± in the words of Justice Thomas¡¯s majority opinion ? Justice Kavanaugh wrote (Page 80): ¡°Those shall-issue regimes may require a license applicant to undergo fingerprinting, a background check, a mental health records check, and training in firearms handling and in laws regarding the use of force, among other possible requirements. Unlike New York¡¯s may-issue regime, those shall-issue regimes do not grant open-ended discretion to licensing officials and do not require a showing of some special need apart from self-defense. As petitioners acknowledge, shall-issue licensing regimes are constitutionally permissible, subject of course to an as-applied challenge if a shall-issue licensing regime does not operate in that manner in practice. Going forward, therefore, the 43 states that employ objective shall-issue licensing regimes for carrying handguns for self-defense may continue to do so. Likewise, the six states including New York potentially affected by today¡¯s decision may continue to require licenses for carrying handguns for self-defense so long as those states employ objective licensing requirements like those used by the 43 shall-issue states.¡±  Jazmine Hughes Members of community-based anti-violence groups expressed dismay following the Supreme Court¡¯s decision to overturn New York¡¯s restrictions on carrying guns, saying it would only make their work harder. ¡°I understand people talking about wanting to feel safe, but you also have people who don¡¯t know how to utilize weapons for protection,¡± said Vanessa Johnson, who worked as a peer violence educator with the city¡¯s Crisis Management System for seven years. ¡°It¡¯s different when you have a firearm to protect yourself and your family, and then people using it senselessly.¡± The ruling came as the city continued to grapple with levels of gun violence far higher than the historic lows that preceded the pandemic. In 2019, there were 777 recorded shooting incidents in New York. The following year, that number doubled to 1,562. Shootings are down about 10 percent so far this year, according to police statistics, but are still well above 2019. Mayor Eric Adams, who focused his campaign on public safety, appointed a gun violence czar this month and has considered declaring a state of emergency in response to a wave of shootings that has now lasted more than two years. Anthony Perkins, the senior advocacy associate for BronxConnect, a community organization to deter violence, worried that the ruling would result in an increase in retaliatory shootings in communities where gun violence is already an issue. Mr. Perkins said that the ruling would challenge both community-based violence disrupters and the police. ¡°All a person has to say now is self-defense, that they felt threatened,¡± Mr. Perkins said. ¡°For some of our communities, feeling threatened is a way of life. If you live in a bad neighborhood, you feel threatened. Now imagine someone who¡¯s a little bit jumpy to begin with, because their neighborhood isn¡¯t the greatest, and now they have a license to carry a gun.¡±  Maggie Astor It was a rare, discordant day in American politics, as two branches of government moved in opposite directions on one of the country¡¯s most intractable issues. The Supreme Court ruled Thursday that the Constitution limits state and local government in restricting guns outside the home. Hours later, the Senate passed a bipartisan set of gun restrictions in response to a series of mass shootings. Before Thursday, the Supreme Court had not issued a major Second Amendment ruling since 2008, and the Senate had not broken a filibuster on a significant firearms bill in nearly three decades. Here is an overview of what happened. The Senate approved bipartisan legislation to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people. The bill passed on a resounding 65-33 vote, with 15 Republicans voting in favor ? a result that seemed politically unthinkable just a few weeks ago. It still needs to pass the House and be signed by President Biden before becoming law, but that is all but assured. The Senate filibuster, which required 60 votes to overcome, was the only serious obstacle, and that is now in the rearview mirror. The bill is a bipartisan compromise in response to mass shootings at a supermarket in Buffalo and an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas. It would strengthen background checks for gun buyers 18 to 21 years old, create incentives for state ¡°red flag¡± laws that let officials temporarily confiscate guns from people deemed at risk of hurting themselves or others, and add unmarried dating partners to a federal law that blocks domestic abusers from buying guns. The Supreme Court struck down a New York law that barred people from carrying a handgun in public unless they had ¡°a special need for self-protection distinguishable from that of the general community.¡± The 6-to-3 decision in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen ? written by Justice Clarence Thomas, the court¡¯s staunchest gun rights supporter ? held that the Second Amendment protects ¡°an individual¡¯s right to carry a handgun for self-defense outside the home.¡± That expanded on the court¡¯s 2008 ruling in District of Columbia v. Heller, which found an individual right to carry a handgun for self-defense inside one¡¯s home. Under the standard established by Thursday¡¯s ruling, lawmakers who wish to restrict gun ownership ¡°must demonstrate that the regulation is consistent with this nation¡¯s historical tradition of firearm regulation.¡± The case concerned a New York requirement that had existed for more than a century. In the short term, the Supreme Court¡¯s decision will affect New York and several other states that have similar laws, including California, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts and New Jersey. But those laws will not disappear immediately. The ruling means the case will return to a lower court in New York for proceedings ¡°consistent with¡± the justices¡¯ opinion, and that court could allow a grace period for legislators to rewrite regulations. Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York, a Democrat, called the ruling ¡°shocking¡± and said she would call a special session of the state legislature to draft laws that could pass muster. Democrats in Maryland said they would also consider passing new laws, and other states may do the same.  Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs In Hawaii, Alan Alexander Beck said his client, George Young, was ¡°ecstatic¡± about the Supreme Court decision. Young has been fighting Hawaii¡¯s law, which is similar to the New York law that was struck down on Thursday. ¡°He¡¯s finally had his Second Amendment rights vindicated,¡± Beck said of Young.  Zolan Kanno-Youngs President Biden tells reporters that while he is disappointed about the Supreme Court ruling on guns, ¡°there is one little bit of solace. The majority opinion has laid out that it affects not every state.¡±  Zach Montague and Maggie Astor Dissenting in the Supreme Court¡¯s ruling on Thursday, Justice Stephen Breyer cited a slew of statistics illustrating the deadly toll of guns. He took particular note of mass shootings, noting that there had already been 277 in the United States this year ? a number that increased by two after he wrote the dissent.  ¡°Many states have tried to address some of the dangers of gun violence just described by passing laws that limit, in various ways, who may purchase, carry or use firearms of different kinds,¡± Justice Breyer wrote. ¡°The court today severely burdens states¡¯ efforts to do so.¡± A string of mass shootings in recent months has pushed Congress to the brink of passing new national regulations on guns. The massacre at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, on May 24, in which 19 children and two teachers were killed, was the deadliest mass shooting in the United States so far this year. It happened just 10 days after 10 people were shot and killed at a supermarket in Buffalo. The Gun Violence Archive, a nonprofit organization, has counted at least 279 such shootings, defined as ones in which four or more people were killed or injured, through this week. (Justice Breyer¡¯s dissent gave the number as 277, saying he last checked the archive Monday; two more occurred that very day.) Of those shootings, 14 involved four or more fatalities. The group recorded 692 mass shootings last year, with 28 involving four or more fatalities. The full toll of gun violence in the United States is far larger, as mass shootings account for only a small percentage of deaths and injuries. Justice Breyer¡¯s dissent began by noting that firearms killed 45,222 Americans in 2020, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and that shootings kill more children and adolescents than any other cause, including motor vehicle crashes. The United States has more civilian-owned firearms than citizens ? about 120 guns per 100 people, according to statistics Justice Breyer cited ? and also has a much higher rate of gun violence than other wealthy democracies. Justice Breyer argued that the six-justice majority that struck down New York¡¯s law had erred by not taking that toll into account and instead basing its application of the Second Amendment ¡°nearly exclusively on history.¡± ¡°It refuses to consider the government interests that justify a challenged gun regulation, regardless of how compelling those interests may be. The Constitution contains no such limitation, and neither do our precedents,¡± he wrote, adding: ¡°In my view, when courts interpret the Second Amendment, it is constitutionally proper, indeed",NYT

Jon Huntsman Jr. stressed that they were not a third-party presidential ticket ? yet. And on issues like climate and guns, they debated their views. By Jonathan Weisman As the ostensibly bipartisan interest group No Labels discovered on Monday, consensus campaigning and governance is all well and good until it comes time for the details. At an event at Saint Anselm College in Manchester, N.H., the group had something of a soft launch of its potential third-party bid for the presidency when Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, and Jon Huntsman Jr., the former Republican governor of Utah, formally released No Labels¡¯ policy manifesto for political compromise. The two men took pains to say they were not the bipartisan presidential ticket of a No Labels candidacy, and that no such ticket would be formed if the Republican and Democratic nominees for 2024 would just embrace their moderation ? ¡°that won¡¯t happen if they¡¯re not threatened,¡± Mr. Manchin said threateningly. On the lofty matter of cooperation and compromise, both men were all in, as were their introducers, Joseph I. Lieberman, a former Democratic senator turned independent, Benjamin Chavis, a civil rights leader and Democrat, and Pat McCrory, a former Republican governor of North Carolina. ¡°The common-sense majority has no voice in this country,¡± Mr. Huntsman said. ¡°They just watch the three-ring circus play out.¡± But the dream unity ticket seemed anything but unified when it came down to the nuts and bolts. One questioner from the audience raised concerns about worsening climate change, the extreme weather that was drenching New England and Mr. Manchin¡¯s securing of a new natural gas pipeline in his home state. To that, Mr. Manchin fell back on his personal preference, promoted in No Labels¡¯ manifesto, for an ¡°all of the above¡± energy policy that embraced renewable energy sources, like wind and solar, as well as continued production of climate-warming fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas. Mr. Huntsman jumped in to propose putting ¡°a price on carbon,¡± something usually done through fossil fuel emissions taxes, to curb oil, gas and coal use, proposals that Mr. Manchin, hailing from a coal and gas state, roundly rejected. Asked about gun control, the two could not even seem to agree on the relatively modest proposals in the No Labels plan: universal background checks on firearms purchases and raising the buying age for military-style semiautomatic weapons to 21 from 18. Mr. Manchin, who co-wrote a universal background check bill in 2012 only to see it die in the Senate, said ¡°there¡¯s a balance to be had¡± in curbing gun purchases. Mr. Huntsman fell back on his party¡¯s decade-long dodge on stricter gun regulation ? mental health care. They even seemed to disagree on Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, the far-right Republican from Georgia. Mr. Huntsman bristled at being asked about her statement that the United States should withdraw from NATO, saying serious policymakers are too often asked questions about ¡°the flamethrowers.¡± Mr. Manchin said he would not speak ill of any sitting member of Congress. ¡°All 535 people elected to Congress want to do good,¡± he said. One thing both men agreed on: No Labels need not divulge the big donors that are fueling the current drive toward a possible third-party bid for the White House. Democratic opponents of the effort have accused the group of hiding a donor list that leans heavily Republican, proof, opponents say, that the drive is all about electing former President Donald J. Trump to a second term. No Labels has denied that but declined to reveal its current donors. ¡°I don¡¯t think it¡¯s right or good. I think there should be transparency and accountability,¡± Mr. Huntsman said of the group¡¯s decision. ¡°But that¡¯s not the way you play the game.¡± He added, ¡°The system sucks.¡± Jonathan Weisman is a Chicago-based political correspondent, veteran journalist and author of the novel ¡°No. 4 Imperial Lane¡± and the nonfiction book ¡°(((Semitism))): Being Jewish in America in the Age of Trump.¡± His career in journalism stretches back 30 years.

By Jim Tankersley WASHINGTON ? President Biden welcomed hundreds of survivors and family members of victims of mass shootings to the White House on Monday to promote newly enacted bipartisan gun legislation, an event that showcased both the president¡¯s desire to push for even more restrictive gun control measures and the political limitations that have held him back. In a sign of the fraught nature of the debate, Mr. Biden¡¯s remarks were interrupted early on by a protester, whose words were inaudible to the White House camera feed and to reporters covering the event in person, but who appeared to be arguing that the president and Congress should take more forceful action on the issue. ¡°Today is many things,¡± Mr. Biden told the crowd. ¡°It is proof that, despite the naysayers, we can make meaningful progress on gun violence.¡± Immediately afterward, a man rose from his seat and began shouting at Mr. Biden. ¡°Sit down and hear what I have to say,¡± Mr. Biden said. The man continued for a moment, then was led away by an administration official. Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, identified the protester as Manuel Oliver, the father of a high school student, Joaquin Oliver, who was killed in the Parkland shooting in 2018. She said Mr. Oliver had been part of a group that met with Mr. Biden earlier in the day, before the event, which Ms. Jean-Pierre said drew 2,000 attendees. ¡°Our hearts go out to Manuel Oliver, who has suffered a deep, deep loss,¡± Ms. Jean-Pierre said. ¡°The president agrees with him. He agrees we need to do more.¡± White House officials said later on Monday that Ms. Jean-Pierre had misspoken, and that Mr. Oliver had met with Mr. Biden earlier this year ? not on Monday. The event, on the South Lawn, appeared to be an attempt by administration officials to portray Mr. Biden as a transformational leader on the gun violence issue, even though the bill he signed into law late last month fell far short of the president¡¯s ambitions for a legislative response to mass shootings in Uvalde, Texas, Buffalo and elsewhere. The audience featured survivors and family members of the victims from multiple decades of mass shootings, including those at Uvalde, Buffalo, Columbine, Virginia Tech, Sandy Hook, Aurora, Colo., Tucson, Ariz., Parkland, Fla., Santa Fe, N.M. and the recent Fourth of July parade shooting in Highland Park, Ill. It also included family members of victims and survivors of what White House officials called ¡°daily acts of gun violence that don¡¯t make national headlines.¡± Vice President Kamala Harris told the crowd that the legislation would not have been possible without Mr. Biden¡¯s ¡°unwavering determination.¡± Ms. Harris and Mr. Biden sought to maintain a difficult balance in their remarks. They promised that the newly signed law ? which was the product of intense negotiation and compromise with Republicans in the Senate ? would save lives, and that it might have helped to stop recent shootings if it had been in place a year ago. But they also said that it did not go far enough. The law, which broke a three-decade logjam on the passage of gun measures in Washington, includes expanded background checks for people younger than 21 who seek to buy guns and allocates millions of dollars for government mental health efforts and implementation of the so-called red flag laws that give officials the ability to temporarily confiscate guns from people deemed dangerous by a judge. It also toughens gun trafficking laws and closes what is known as the boyfriend loophole in a ban on firearm purchases by domestic abusers. ¡°It matters,¡± Mr. Biden said. ¡°It matters. But it¡¯s not enough, we all know that.¡± Mr. Biden used his remarks to renew his call for a new ban on assault weapons; a previous ban, which Mr. Biden helped enact as a senator in 1994, expired after 10 years. Other speakers echoed his words. ¡°I invite everyone to move forward from this start of the change that will allow us to make it to the end of our fight, which is a world where the safety of schools is never doubted and weapons of war are not allowed in our communities,¡± Dr. Roy Guerrero, a pediatrician in Uvalde, said in introducing Ms. Harris. But the ranks of the crowd underscored how difficult it would be for Mr. Biden to follow through on his pledge and enact any additional gun measures. Though about 80 members of Congress joined the event, only two were Republicans: Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, who helped lead the negotiations on the bipartisan bill, and Representative Tony Gonzales, whose district includes Uvalde. Many other Republicans have criticized the bipartisan bill as going too far in restricting gun-owners¡¯ rights. Mr. Biden offered no plans on Monday to win Republican converts in order to pass a new gun bill through the Senate, or to persuade holdout Democratic senators to lift the filibuster and pass such a bill by a simple majority vote. At a time when activists have criticized him for not leading more forcefully on guns, abortion, climate change and more, the president closed his speech by reeling off statistics about people, particularly children, killed every year by gun violence. ¡°We can¡¯t just stand by,¡± he said. ¡°We can¡¯t let it happen any longer.¡±  Jim Tankersley is a White House correspondent with a focus on economic policy.

By Catie Edmondson WASHINGTON ? The House approved a pair of bills on Thursday aimed at expanding and strengthening background checks for gun buyers, as Democrats pushed past Republican opposition to advance major gun safety measures after decades of congressional inaction. In two votes that fell largely along party lines, the House passed legislation that would require background checks for all gun buyers, and extend the time the F.B.I. has to vet those flagged by the national instant check system. Despite being widely popular with voters, the measures face what is expected to be insurmountable opposition in the Senate, where Republicans have resisted imposing any limits on guns, including stricter background check requirements. The House voted 227 to 203 to approve the expansion of background checks, and 219 to 210 to give federal law enforcement more time to vet gun buyers. Both pieces of legislation are aimed at addressing gaps in existing gun laws, including the so-called Charleston loophole, which restricts to three days the period the F.B.I. has to conduct a background check, allowing many buyers to evade them. The provision allowed Dylann Roof, the white supremacist who killed nine people in 2015 at a historically Black church in Charleston, S.C., to buy a handgun even though he should have been barred from doing so. The bill would extend the amount of time the F.B.I. has to complete a check for an additional week, to 10 days. The other measure passed on Thursday would require those buying firearms from private sellers online or purchasing them at gun shows to have their backgrounds vetted before they could receive the weapon. They are not currently required to do so, although in-person buyers, who make up the majority of gun purchases, are. ¡°Let¡¯s not add more names to this registry of grief,¡± Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the No. 2 Democrat, said, reading from a lengthy list of recent mass shootings and noting that they had fallen sharply in the past year. ¡°Let¡¯s not rely on a pandemic to do what we ought to have done so long ago. Let¡¯s pass these bills and reduce gun violence the right way.¡± Democrats first passed the legislation in 2019, shortly after they recaptured control of the House, making it a centerpiece of their agenda as they sought to capitalize on an outpouring of student activism in favor of stricter gun safety measures after a school shooting in 2018 in Parkland, Fla. Polling then and now, conducted by multiple companies, shows that over 80 percent of voters support the legislation. Last month, President Biden called on Congress to enact the bills in a statement commemorating the third anniversary of the Parkland shooting. ¡°This administration will not wait for the next mass shooting to heed that call,¡± he said. On Thursday, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and many other House Democrats wore orange clothing or face masks in solidarity with the gun safety movement, erupting in applause on the floor when the bills passed. Still, the legislation will join a growing stack of items on the liberal agenda that are widely popular with voters but appear destined to languish in the 50-50 Senate, where Democrats must win the support of 10 Republicans to pass most major measures. It is part of a concerted strategy by Democrats to increase pressure on those in their ranks who are resistant to eliminating the legislative filibuster, and to force Republicans to take politically unpopular votes before the 2022 midterm elections. ¡°A vote is what we need, not hopes and prayers,¡± Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said on Thursday during a news conference. ¡°We will see where people stand.¡± In a statement, Brian M. Lemek, the executive director of the Brady political action committee, which supports candidates who endorse universal background checks, said the group would ¡°make sure every voter knows and doesn¡¯t forget who did and did not vote for this lifesaving piece of legislation.¡± The group plans to spend ¡°upwards of $10 million¡± in the coming midterm election cycle, a spokeswoman said. House Republicans almost uniformly opposed the measures, arguing that the legislation would not make it harder for criminals to improperly receive weapons, but would impose a significant burden on law-abiding citizens attempting to purchase a firearm. ¡°These rights protect my life, liberty, and property,¡± said Representative Burgess Owens, Republican of Utah. ¡°They were granted to me by God; they cannot be taken away from me by D.C. bureaucrats.¡± Eight Republicans voted to advance the universal background legislation, while one Democrat, Representative Jared Golden of Maine, opposed it. Two Republicans supported extending the length of checks from three to 10 days, while two Democrats, Mr. Golden and Ron Kind of Wisconsin, broke with their party to oppose it. Gun sales have surged in the past year, requiring the F.B.I. to conduct more background checks than before, according to data obtained by Everytown for Gun Safety, a nonprofit dedicated to antigun violence. That data showed that over 10 months in 2020, the F.B.I. reported 5,807 sales to prohibited buyers through the Charleston loophole, more than in any other entire calendar year. An earlier version of this article referred imprecisely to which online gun purchases are currently subject to background checks. Online buyers of firearms from private sellers are not required to undergo such checks, while other online purchasers are.?

But activists have increased financing and grass-roots energy as they pursue their cause.  By Reid J. Epstein,?Maggie Astor and Danny Hakim WASHINGTON ? The political momentum in the gun control debate has shifted in the year leading up to this weekend¡¯s mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton, Ohio, with gun control advocates taking a more empowered stance and the National Rifle Association consumed by internal power struggles. The major gun control organizations, propelled by funding from supporters like Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor, and grass-roots networks across the country, have helped enact new laws ? mostly in Democratic-controlled states ? and, for the first time in 25 years, passed a significant gun control bill in the House.  But the gun lobby¡¯s structural advantages, built over decades and defended by President Trump and congressional Republicans, remain in place: an N.R.A. budget that dwarfs what even Mr. Bloomberg has spent, a Republican Senate majority disinclined to consider gun-control legislation, and a base of primary voters for whom the N.R.A.¡¯s endorsement is a critical seal of approval.  The net effect is a playing field on gun issues that is far more level than it has been since N.R.A.-backed Republicans took over Congress in 1994, sparking one of the country¡¯s most bitter, partisan culture wars. Yet in the immediate aftermath of the weekend massacres, there were few signs the El Paso and Dayton mass shootings would lead to calls for additional gun restrictions any different from those already being pushed by Democrats.  Though the United States experiences hundreds of mass shootings each year, few have captured enough public attention to force even incremental change. And even in cases when gun control legislation is drafted, the N.R.A. and its allies in elected office have almost always defeated it. On Sunday, activists and Democrats, including the leading candidates for president, reiterated chronic pleas for the Republican-controlled Senate to take action on the gun control bill that House Democrats passed in February, a measure that would require background checks for all gun buyers.  ¡°The Senate should come back from recess and immediately vote on laws that we know work and save lives,¡± said Shannon Watts, the founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, the grass-roots gun control organization funded largely by Mr. Bloomberg. ¡°If Congress continues to sit on its hands, then we will work even harder to make sure that we have a gun-sense majority in Congress and a president who will do the right thing.¡± Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, called the attacks this weekend ¡°horrifying¡± in a Twitter post, but said nothing about legislation.  ¡°Sickening to learn this morning of another mass murder in Dayton, Ohio overnight,¡± he tweeted on Sunday. ¡°Two horrifying acts of violence in less than 24 hours. We stand with law enforcement as they continue working to keep Americans safe and bring justice.¡± But Senate Democrats may not get off easy by just blaming Mr. McConnell. The spate of mass shootings in recent years has led an array of activist groups to adopt positions that were once relegated to the far fringes of the gun debate; these groups now aim to hold accountable Democrats who they believe do not fight hard enough for gun control measures.  [A weekend of gun violence stuns the country] ¡°They must do everything in their power, everything in their capacity as a senator, from holding a filibuster, to placing a hold on nominees and key bills, to getting back to D.C. right now to show the nation that they are willing to act,¡± said Igor Volsky, the executive director of Guns Down America. ¡°It¡¯s not enough to simply ask Mitch McConnell to bring something to a vote. They have to use their leverage as a United States senator to shame him into taking action.¡±  Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut, who has pushed for gun control legislation since the 2012 elementary school massacre in Newtown, Conn., said Sunday that he¡¯d spent the weekend discussing gun control proposals with his Republican colleagues.  If Republicans won¡¯t budge, then Democrats will ¡°have to get together and figure out what leverage we have in the Senate,¡± Mr. Murphy said in an interview. But realistically, he said, gun control may only pass the Senate if Democrats control the chamber.  ¡°It¡¯s my responsibility to try to find a legislative path, but I¡¯m not going to take too many kicks at the football if it keeps getting pulled out from under us,¡± Mr. Murphy said. ¡°I think we have had our eyes firmly on the electoral path since the spring of 2013, and we probably have to keep it there.¡± Representative Mike Thompson, a California Democrat who leads the House¡¯s Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, said members were working on additional legislation ? including restrictions on high-capacity magazines ? despite the challenges of passing the measures in the Senate.  ¡°Sadly, we know that the issue of gun violence prevention is a partisan issue,¡± Mr. Thompson said. ¡°We saw that firsthand with the House Republicans holding up any hearings on gun violence prevention, any votes on gun violence prevention, for six and a half years after Sandy Hook. Once the Democrats took over the House, that changed.¡± There was no sign over the weekend that Republicans¡¯ opposition to new gun laws had softened. In appearances on Fox News, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the House minority leader, and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick of Texas blamed violent video games ? to which the N.R.A. has long sought to shift blame ? for the proliferation of mass shootings.  ¡°We¡¯ve always had guns and evil,¡± Mr. Patrick said in the Fox interview. ¡°I see a video game industry that teaches young people to kill.¡± [Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter.] Violent video games are common in many other countries, which do not experience mass shootings at anywhere near the level the United States does. But no other country has as many guns: Americans own an estimated 393 million guns, according to a 2018 study, more than the nation¡¯s population. In a major shift from past presidential campaigns, the 2020 Democratic candidates are unanimous in their support of universal background checks and other restrictions. Many have gone further, calling for reinstatement of the expired 1994 assault weapons ban ? part of a crime bill written by former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. ? as well as offering more robust proposals. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey has called for a federal gun licensing program. ¡°Enough is enough is enough, and it¡¯s been enough for the past five years,¡± Mr. Biden said at a campaign event in Las Vegas late Saturday. Both sides have claimed victories at the state level. In 2019, 17 states, all but three of them with Democratic legislatures, and Washington, D.C., enacted 35 laws that restricted gun ownership. At the same time, Republicans in Florida enacted legislation allowing teachers to carry guns in their classrooms, Idaho lowered its age for carrying a weapon without a permit to 18, and several states now allow residents to carry concealed weapons without a permit.  Further complicating the gun-control debate is that the N.R.A. has been in turmoil, mired in financial scandal, investigations, infighting and revelations that it was targeted by Russia.  In April, a power struggle with Wayne LaPierre, the N.R.A.¡¯s longtime chief executive, led to the departure of Oliver North, the group¡¯s former president, leading Mr. Trump to implore the group to ¡°stop the internal fighting, & get back to GREATNESS - FAST!¡± But the turmoil continued, and Christopher W. Cox, the N.R.A.¡¯s top lobbyist and second-in-command ? and a friend of Donald Trump Jr. ? was forced out in June. The N.R.A. has turned over thousands of pages of records in congressional investigations of its ties to Russia. It is also facing investigations by the attorneys general of New York and Washington, D.C. And it is mired in a bitter legal fight with Ackerman McQueen, an advertising firm that was for decades its most influential contractor.  But the N.R.A. remains formidable, with an overall budget that dwarfs that of any gun control group, and it is unlikely to moderate its positions.  After 30 hours of silence following initial reports of the El Paso massacre, the N.R.A. released a statement offering ¡°our deepest sympathies¡± to victims in El Paso and Dayton.  ¡°We will not participate in the politicizing of these tragedies,¡± said N.R.A. spokesman Andrew Arulanandam. ¡°As always, we will work in good faith to pursue real solutions that protect us all from people who commit these horrific acts.¡±  Perhaps a more telling statement came Saturday morning, before the Texas shooting, when Willes Lee, the group¡¯s second vice president, tweeted: ¡°Where do you feel least safe, most vulnerable? Exactly. A gun free zone. Tell elected officials & business owners they are responsible for innocent people losing lives.¡± Still, gun control advocates believe the N.R.A. is in its weakest position since 1994. With Mr. Trump in the White House, the organization can no longer say that a hostile administration is threatening to take away Americans¡¯ guns.  Some prominent Republicans, including Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Marco Rubio of Florida, do support extreme-risk protection orders, commonly known as red-flag laws. This in itself is a significant shift, and in an interview earlier this year, Mr. Rubio said he had been influenced by how routine mass shootings had become. ¡°I remember being at a confirmation service for my nephew, and somehow the thought crept into my head: What if somebody walked in here now and started shooting?¡± he said. ¡°I never used to think about those things. So absolutely, it has an impact on people, and people want action.¡± After the shooting in El Paso, Mr. Graham tweeted that it was ¡°time to do more than pray,¡± but did not elaborate. For Democrats in Washington, the political winds on gun control have shifted dramatically since Sandy Hook. Of the 235 Democrats in the House now, just three received ¡°A¡± ratings from the N.R.A. last year: Representatives Sanford Bishop of Georgia, Collin Peterson of Minnesota and Henry Cuellar of Texas. Mr. Cuellar has a Democratic challenger for 2020 who has sought to make his position on gun control an issue in the primary. By contrast, in 2008, voters elected 67 Democrats with A ratings. Among Democrats, there was little appetite after the El Paso and Dayton massacres for the typical offering of thoughts and prayers for the victims.  ¡°No more thoughts and prayers,¡± Senator Kamala Harris of California wrote on Sunday in a fund-raising solicitation for three gun control groups. ¡°We need action.¡±  Reid J.

https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/24/us/uvalde-shooting-fallout.html?searchResultPosition=109,2023-05-24,A Year After the Uvalde Massacre: Did Anything Change?,"After a failed police response to the shooting deaths of 19 students and two teachers in Uvalde, Texas, there were calls for accountability and new gun laws. By Edgar Sandoval Reporting from Uvalde, Texas The shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, last May in some ways changed the conversation yet again on gun violence in the United States: 19 fourth-grade students and two teachers died in one of the deadliest school shootings in American history. But what made the Uvalde attack extraordinary was not just the death toll. It was the fact that more than 370 officers from local, state and federal agencies had responded to the scene ? some standing in the school hallway ? but allowed the gunman to remain holed up with students inside the school for 77 minutes before storming in to kill him. In the aftermath, that left a host of questions, not only about the laws governing access to guns but also about police training, emergency responses, school security and preparedness, and who ultimately would be held accountable for a failure that occurred on so many levels. In the year since the attack, a number of people have resigned or lost their jobs. New laws have been debated, and some have been passed. Criminal investigations have been opened. Survivors have undergone months of physical therapy. Those who did not survive have been buried. Did any of it make another mass shooting less likely? In Uvalde, people have had their doubts. ¡°Almost a year now, and honestly nothing has changed,¡± Jesse Rizo, the uncle of one of the massacre victims, told the Uvalde school board in the weeks before Wednesday¡¯s anniversary of the shooting. The gunman climbed a low fence and entered the school through what turned out to be an unlocked door at around 11:30 a.m. that Tuesday, as students in the classrooms mainly targeted, Rooms 111 and 112, were watching movies. Within minutes, several officers, including the chief of the small school police force, Pete Arredondo, arrived and followed the sounds of gunfire to the two classrooms. Two officers were grazed by bullets as they approached one of the classroom doors and pulled back. Mr. Arredondo made the decision to treat the situation not as an active shooting but as a barricaded subject incident, and a decision was made to wait until a heavily armed tactical team from the Border Patrol arrived with better equipment to breach the classroom. Steven McCraw, the head of the Texas Department of Public Safety, immediately laid most of the blame on Mr. Arredondo for the delay, but a special Texas House committee report on the shooting found that the failure was ¡°systemic,¡± noting that scores of officers were there and that they also failed to act, even as children were dialing 911 from inside the classrooms. Would a faster police response have saved lives? There is still no clear answer to that question. The victims suffered terrible injuries and most appear to have died right away. But some died on the way to the hospital and in a final footnote in the report, the committee concluded, ¡°It is plausible that some victims could have survived if they had not had to wait¡± for rescue. Mr. Arredondo was among the first to go, when the school board voted unanimously in August to fire him, to the sound of cheers and claps in the packed school auditorium. Lawyers for Mr. Arredondo, who has said that officers reasonably focused on preventing the bloodshed from expanding to other classrooms, called his firing ¡°an unconstitutional public lynching.¡± The school district later dismantled its entire police force, which consisted of five officers, and is still in the process of revamping it with new hires. The city police force did not emerge unchanged, either: The lieutenant who was in charge on May 24 while the police chief was on vacation, Mariano Pargas Jr., stepped down in mid-November after 18 years in the force. And amid pressure from the families of the 21 victims, Hal Harrell, the school superintendent, retired in the fall. He was replaced in the interim by Gary Patterson, a former superintendent from San Antonio. The Texas Department of Public Safety, the state police agency that includes the Texas Rangers, also took steps to push out at least two out of the seven officers who were under investigation for their role in the response, including Sgt. Juan Maldonado and a Texas Ranger, Christopher Ryan Kindell, although some of those investigations are still pending. The local district attorney, Christina Mitchell, is still looking into whether criminal charges should be brought against any of the police responders. Ms. Mitchell has said that she intends to present any evidence of criminal wrongdoing to a grand jury. No decision is expected for months. Investigations are also still pending from the Justice Department and the City of Uvalde, which has hired an independent investigator. ¡°Everybody that was there that day has to be held accountable,¡± said Uvalde¡¯s mayor, Don McLaughlin. The response by officers in Uvalde has been broadly condemned. But it has not resulted in immediate changes to how police officers are trained in Texas. Last July, Mr. McCraw, the state public safety director, said his agency would ¡°provide proper training and guidelines for recognizing and overcoming poor command decisions at an active shooter scene.¡± But several policing experts said that creating that kind of training presented a challenge because countermanding orders from an incident commander went against the very orientation of most police departments. And the state has yet to roll out new training based on last year¡¯s directive. In the meantime, the focus has been on increased safety precautions and better equipment. In Uvalde, local police now have additional ballistic shields and helmets, as well as new tools for breaching barricaded doors. At schools in Uvalde, school administrators have installed new eight-foot fences, sensors that would alert staff if a door did not lock properly and more security cameras to monitor activity outside all schools. The school where the attack occurred sits behind chain-link fencing with its windows boarded over, and is slated to be demolished as soon as lawsuits and the pending investigations are concluded. Ms. Mitchell, the district attorney, and many victims¡¯ families are among those taking legal action to block the demolition of the school until there is no further need to collect evidence from the crime scene. Mr. Patterson, the interim superintendent, said plans for a permanent memorial were under discussion, but it has not yet been decided what and where that would be. A new elementary school is to be built three miles from where Robb Elementary now sits. The new school, which does not have a name yet, is scheduled to open its doors in 2024, said Eulalio Diaz Jr., a member of an advisory committee overseeing planning for the new campus. Early designs include the colors of papel picado, the traditional Mexican folk art that features multicolor sheets of paper ? in recognition of the Hispanic culture that has long been a large part of Uvalde, and the families at Robb Elementary. For now, Robb Elementary¡¯s students have been dispersed to other schools. Texas has moved to widen access to firearms in the year since the shooting. Months before the attack, Texas lawmakers did away with permit requirements to carry handguns. After the attack, the state also effectively lowered the age required for carrying a handgun to 18 from 21, once officials stopped defending the higher age limit in court in December. There had been slight movement in the Legislature in early May, when a bill that would have raised the age to purchase an AR-15-style rifle to 21 from 18 received a favorable vote in a House committee. The legislation would possibly have prevented the 18-year-old gunman in Uvalde from purchasing the weapon he used in the massacre. But the bill missed a key deadline and failed to receive a vote in the full Texas House. Elsewhere in the country, there has been a mixed record on gun control laws proposed since Uvalde, with access restricted or expanded depending on which party is in control. Washington State, where Democrats control state government, last month became at least the ninth state to join efforts to prevent the distribution of AR-15s and other powerful rifles often used by mass shooters, after the earlier lead of states like California, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Massachusetts. Republicans have moved in the opposite direction, with lawmakers in several states introducing legislation to expand the ability to carry concealed weapons without a permit and eliminate such things as gun-free zones. Last summer the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill that would have reinstated a federal ban on assault weapons, but it stalled in the Senate. Also last summer, Congress passed a new federal gun bill that brought the often-divided legislature together, galvanized by the tragedy in Uvalde. Democrats and just enough Republicans approved a measure that enhances background checks for potential gun buyers under 21, allowing law enforcement agencies to check juvenile records, including mental health records, starting at 16. President Biden has signed it into law. The law also provides millions of dollars for states to put red flag laws in place, strengthens laws against straw purchasing and trafficking of guns, and provides funding for mental health crisis intervention. Gun violence activists, including the Uvalde families, said they planned to return to Washington, D.C., to lobby for a total ban on assault weapons. J. David Goodman contributed reporting.

https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/26/us/politics/senate-gun-control.html?searchResultPosition=110,2022-06-02,"Democrats Hit Pause on Gun Control Vote, Hoping for a Compromise","After the deadliest school shooting in a decade, the top Senate Democrat said he would wait to force a vote on gun safety measures the G.O.P. has opposed. By Jonathan Weisman and Emily Cochrane Follow our live updates on President Biden¡¯s speech on gun control tonight. WASHINGTON ? Just shy of a decade after the Senate¡¯s failure to respond to the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, Democrats are again trying to transform outrage over the gun deaths of children into action by Congress to curb gun violence in America. But with the Republican position more intractable than ever, calls for negotiations to find some response to the recent horrors in Uvalde, Texas, and Buffalo, N.Y., left few lawmakers with much hope that Congress would produce anything meaningful. ¡°Please, please, please, damn it, put yourselves in the shoes of these parents for once,¡± Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the majority leader, pleaded with his Republican colleagues, as he made the case for at least expanding background checks on gun purchasers. Polls show that the proposal has support from as many as 90 percent of Americans, including many G.O.P. voters, but Republicans have effectively blocked action on it for the better part of a decade. Their stance reflects the potency of the issue of gun rights for the Republican base voters, whose zeal for the 2nd Amendment means that any G.O.P. lawmaker who embraces even the most modest form of gun control runs the risk of a primary challenge that could cost him his job. Still, after Mr. Schumer initially cleared the way for a quick vote to put Republicans on the spot on background checks, he pulled back on Wednesday and said there was no point in doing so, given that their opposition was already ¡°crystal clear.¡± Instead, he said he would try to find a consensus proposal that could draw in enough Republicans to break the inevitable filibuster. ¡°The plan is to work hard at a compromise for the next 10 days,¡± Senator Christopher S. Murphy of Connecticut, who has led the Democratic charge for gun safety legislation since Sandy Hook, said on Twitter on Tuesday. ¡°Hopefully we succeed and the Senate can vote on a bipartisan bill that saves lives. But if we can¡¯t find common ground, then we are going to take a vote on gun violence. The Senate will not ignore this crisis.¡± On Thursday, the Senate will face the first test, moving to take up legislation approved by the House last week after the racist mass shooting in Buffalo, to bolster federal resources to prevent domestic terrorism. Mr. Schumer said if Republicans do not filibuster the procedural motion just to take up the measure, he will open the bill up to amendments from both parties to address gun violence. There was little sign that a consensus was in the offing. Republicans proposed the now-familiar litany of alternative responses ? tighter ¡°red flag¡± laws to make it easier for law enforcement to confiscate weapons from the mentally ill, more aggressive mental health interventions, and more armed guards at schools ? many of which Democrats regard as woefully inadequate. And Democrats questioned whether they could find any common ground with Republicans on more substantial gun violence measures, after previous proposals ultimately went nowhere. ¡°We¡¯ve been burned so many times before¡± when it came to negotiating a bipartisan compromise, Mr. Schumer said. The echoes between the Newtown, Conn., mass shooting at Sandy Hook in December 2012, which left 20 children and six adults dead, and the Uvalde, Texas, violence, which killed at least 19 children and two teachers, are painful. In both cases, a loner from the community attacked an elementary school, overpowering children and adults with an arsenal. After Newtown, then-Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. was charged with persuading a bipartisan coalition of at least 60 senators to act, and break a threatened filibuster by Republicans. On Tuesday night, a seemingly anguished President Biden made the case for ¡°common sense gun laws,¡± including an assault weapons ban, and declared, ¡°It¡¯s time to turn this pain into action.¡± But in remarks on Wednesday, Mr. Biden, too, appeared to hang back rather than call for specific action by Congress, referring vaguely to the need to show ¡°backbone¡± and challenge the powerful gun lobby. Then, as now, bipartisan legislation existed, written by Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, and Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, to impose universal criminal background checks for gun purchasers at gun shows and in internet sales. Then, as now, the barrier was the Senate¡¯s requirement of 60 votes necessary to overcome a filibuster. But in the intervening years, the partisan lines between Republican and Democrat have only hardened, not only on gun rights but on the much broader question of how to balance individual liberty against collective responsibility. On gun control, climate change, taxation and pandemic safety mandates, Republicans have seemingly decided individual rights trump a collective, societal response, regardless of the cost. ¡°Maybe it¡¯s a personal responsibility not to shoot people with guns,¡± said Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, ¡°and maybe people who don¡¯t live up to that responsibility ought to be in prison for a very, very long time ? like forever.¡± Beyond elective office, some Republicans seemed to have had enough. Bill Frist, a former Tennessee senator who served as majority leader from 2003 to 2007, wrote on Twitter: ¡°I can¡¯t imagine this is what the Founding Fathers hoped for or intended. We can find ways to preserve the intent of the Second Amendment while also safeguarding the lives of our children.¡± Such sentiments were hard to find among elected Republicans. Mr. Schumer framed his call for negotiations as strategic. A quick vote on House-passed legislation to strengthen background checks would all but certainly be filibustered. Republicans would complain about wasting time with political show votes. Democrats would castigate Republicans for their opposition. Nothing would be accomplished, and the Senate would move on. Negotiations, at least, could keep gun safety a live issue for a while. ¡°When things like this happen, I think it awakens sensibilities to the bigger picture ? I will not say greater good, but the greater collective response,¡± Senator Shelley Moore Capito, Republican of West Virginia, said of the Uvalde bloodshed. ¡°I think that¡¯s what we¡¯re all probably grappling with right now.¡± But it was not clear that much had changed. Mr. Manchin indicated that he was not dropping his opposition to changing the Senate filibuster rules, which would allow Democrats to push through gun control legislation over unified Republican opposition. He insisted that, with good will, a broad compromise could be reached and such a move would be unnecessary. ¡°If we can¡¯t get 70 or 75 senators that won¡¯t vote to have a common sense protection of your children and grandchildren, what in the world are we here for?¡± Mr. Manchin demanded. ¡°What¡¯s your purpose for being in the United States Senate? If it¡¯s not at least to protect the children?¡± The initial start to talks has begun. Mr. Murphy reached out to Mr. Toomey and Senator Susan Collins of Maine, two of the four Republicans who voted for the bipartisan background check bill co-sponsored by Mr. Manchin in 2013. ¡°My interest in doing something to improve and expand our background check system remains,¡± Mr. Toomey told reporters. The April 2013 vote for universal background checks garnered 54 votes. But eight of the ¡°yes¡± votes for the bill have been replaced over the past decade by the potential votes of conservative Republicans. On the other hand, five of the 2013 ¡°no¡± votes have been replaced by Democrats ? two in Georgia, one in New Hampshire, one in Arizona and one in Nevada. But with a 60-vote threshold to clear in the Senate, the odds were still long. There was little indication that the murdered children of Uvalde, Texas, would shake the near-unanimous opposition to any measure limiting access to guns. Asked what he would tell the parents of the slain children, Senator Tommy Tuberville, Republican of Alabama, told reporters, ¡°I¡¯m willing to say that I¡¯m very sorry it happened. But guns are not the problem, OK? People are the problem. That¡¯s where it starts, and we¡¯ve had guns forever. And we¡¯re going to continue to have guns.¡± The two Democratic opponents to changing the filibuster rule, Mr. Manchin and Senator Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, appeared similarly unmoved on that position. ¡°Despite the fact that there is always heated rhetoric here in D.C., I do think there is an opportunity for us to actually have real conversations and try and do something,¡± without ditching the filibuster, Ms. Sinema said, speaking to reporters on Capitol Hill. The heated language extended far beyond Washington. On Wednesday, Beto O¡¯Rourke, the former Democratic representative now challenging Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, confronted the governor and other state officials who oppose gun control measures during their visit to Uvalde, interrupting their news conference to castigate them for ¡°doing nothing¡± to address gun violence.  At the Capitol, some Republicans rushed to propose solutions that would sidestep the issue of guns altogether. Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, went to the Senate floor to request agreement to take up his bill to establish a federal clearinghouse on school safety best practices. Democrats refused. As lawmakers talked past each other, it was not clear that anything under discussion would address the recent mass shootings. Republicans have long favored more armed guards, arguing that the only way to stop a bad person with a gun is to ensure more good people have guns. But in Buffalo and Uvalde, the gunmen were confronted by armed guards, who were unable to prevent the slaughter. For all the talk of red flag laws, the killer in Texas did not appear to have any known mental health issues. Likewise, the most recent mass shootings were apparently perpetrated with guns lawfully purchased, which would not have been subject to additional scrutiny under Democratic background check bills. Legislation that would have directly impacted the possibility of carnage ? bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines ? are no longer a main feature in Democrats¡¯ gun safety agenda, although Mr. Biden has mentioned them repeatedly in recent days.

But activists have increased financing and grass-roots energy as they pursue their cause.  By Reid J. Epstein,?Maggie Astor and Danny Hakim WASHINGTON ? The political momentum in the gun control debate has shifted in the year leading up to this weekend¡¯s mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton, Ohio, with gun control advocates taking a more empowered stance and the National Rifle Association consumed by internal power struggles. The major gun control organizations, propelled by funding from supporters like Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor, and grass-roots networks across the country, have helped enact new laws ? mostly in Democratic-controlled states ? and, for the first time in 25 years, passed a significant gun control bill in the House.  But the gun lobby¡¯s structural advantages, built over decades and defended by President Trump and congressional Republicans, remain in place: an N.R.A. budget that dwarfs what even Mr. Bloomberg has spent, a Republican Senate majority disinclined to consider gun-control legislation, and a base of primary voters for whom the N.R.A.¡¯s endorsement is a critical seal of approval.  The net effect is a playing field on gun issues that is far more level than it has been since N.R.A.-backed Republicans took over Congress in 1994, sparking one of the country¡¯s most bitter, partisan culture wars. Yet in the immediate aftermath of the weekend massacres, there were few signs the El Paso and Dayton mass shootings would lead to calls for additional gun restrictions any different from those already being pushed by Democrats.  Though the United States experiences hundreds of mass shootings each year, few have captured enough public attention to force even incremental change. And even in cases when gun control legislation is drafted, the N.R.A. and its allies in elected office have almost always defeated it. On Sunday, activists and Democrats, including the leading candidates for president, reiterated chronic pleas for the Republican-controlled Senate to take action on the gun control bill that House Democrats passed in February, a measure that would require background checks for all gun buyers.  ¡°The Senate should come back from recess and immediately vote on laws that we know work and save lives,¡± said Shannon Watts, the founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, the grass-roots gun control organization funded largely by Mr. Bloomberg. ¡°If Congress continues to sit on its hands, then we will work even harder to make sure that we have a gun-sense majority in Congress and a president who will do the right thing.¡± Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, called the attacks this weekend ¡°horrifying¡± in a Twitter post, but said nothing about legislation.  ¡°Sickening to learn this morning of another mass murder in Dayton, Ohio overnight,¡± he tweeted on Sunday. ¡°Two horrifying acts of violence in less than 24 hours. We stand with law enforcement as they continue working to keep Americans safe and bring justice.¡± But Senate Democrats may not get off easy by just blaming Mr. McConnell. The spate of mass shootings in recent years has led an array of activist groups to adopt positions that were once relegated to the far fringes of the gun debate; these groups now aim to hold accountable Democrats who they believe do not fight hard enough for gun control measures.  [A weekend of gun violence stuns the country] ¡°They must do everything in their power, everything in their capacity as a senator, from holding a filibuster, to placing a hold on nominees and key bills, to getting back to D.C. right now to show the nation that they are willing to act,¡± said Igor Volsky, the executive director of Guns Down America. ¡°It¡¯s not enough to simply ask Mitch McConnell to bring something to a vote. They have to use their leverage as a United States senator to shame him into taking action.¡±  Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut, who has pushed for gun control legislation since the 2012 elementary school massacre in Newtown, Conn., said Sunday that he¡¯d spent the weekend discussing gun control proposals with his Republican colleagues.  If Republicans won¡¯t budge, then Democrats will ¡°have to get together and figure out what leverage we have in the Senate,¡± Mr. Murphy said in an interview. But realistically, he said, gun control may only pass the Senate if Democrats control the chamber.  ¡°It¡¯s my responsibility to try to find a legislative path, but I¡¯m not going to take too many kicks at the football if it keeps getting pulled out from under us,¡± Mr. Murphy said. ¡°I think we have had our eyes firmly on the electoral path since the spring of 2013, and we probably have to keep it there.¡± Representative Mike Thompson, a California Democrat who leads the House¡¯s Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, said members were working on additional legislation ? including restrictions on high-capacity magazines ? despite the challenges of passing the measures in the Senate.  ¡°Sadly, we know that the issue of gun violence prevention is a partisan issue,¡± Mr. Thompson said. ¡°We saw that firsthand with the House Republicans holding up any hearings on gun violence prevention, any votes on gun violence prevention, for six and a half years after Sandy Hook. Once the Democrats took over the House, that changed.¡± There was no sign over the weekend that Republicans¡¯ opposition to new gun laws had softened. In appearances on Fox News, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the House minority leader, and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick of Texas blamed violent video games ? to which the N.R.A. has long sought to shift blame ? for the proliferation of mass shootings.  ¡°We¡¯ve always had guns and evil,¡± Mr. Patrick said in the Fox interview. ¡°I see a video game industry that teaches young people to kill.¡± [Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter.] Violent video games are common in many other countries, which do not experience mass shootings at anywhere near the level the United States does. But no other country has as many guns: Americans own an estimated 393 million guns, according to a 2018 study, more than the nation¡¯s population. In a major shift from past presidential campaigns, the 2020 Democratic candidates are unanimous in their support of universal background checks and other restrictions. Many have gone further, calling for reinstatement of the expired 1994 assault weapons ban ? part of a crime bill written by former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. ? as well as offering more robust proposals. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey has called for a federal gun licensing program. ¡°Enough is enough is enough, and it¡¯s been enough for the past five years,¡± Mr. Biden said at a campaign event in Las Vegas late Saturday. Both sides have claimed victories at the state level. In 2019, 17 states, all but three of them with Democratic legislatures, and Washington, D.C., enacted 35 laws that restricted gun ownership. At the same time, Republicans in Florida enacted legislation allowing teachers to carry guns in their classrooms, Idaho lowered its age for carrying a weapon without a permit to 18, and several states now allow residents to carry concealed weapons without a permit.  Further complicating the gun-control debate is that the N.R.A. has been in turmoil, mired in financial scandal, investigations, infighting and revelations that it was targeted by Russia.  In April, a power struggle with Wayne LaPierre, the N.R.A.¡¯s longtime chief executive, led to the departure of Oliver North, the group¡¯s former president, leading Mr. Trump to implore the group to ¡°stop the internal fighting, & get back to GREATNESS - FAST!¡± But the turmoil continued, and Christopher W. Cox, the N.R.A.¡¯s top lobbyist and second-in-command ? and a friend of Donald Trump Jr. ? was forced out in June. The N.R.A. has turned over thousands of pages of records in congressional investigations of its ties to Russia. It is also facing investigations by the attorneys general of New York and Washington, D.C. And it is mired in a bitter legal fight with Ackerman McQueen, an advertising firm that was for decades its most influential contractor.  But the N.R.A. remains formidable, with an overall budget that dwarfs that of any gun control group, and it is unlikely to moderate its positions.  After 30 hours of silence following initial reports of the El Paso massacre, the N.R.A. released a statement offering ¡°our deepest sympathies¡± to victims in El Paso and Dayton.  ¡°We will not participate in the politicizing of these tragedies,¡± said N.R.A. spokesman Andrew Arulanandam. ¡°As always, we will work in good faith to pursue real solutions that protect us all from people who commit these horrific acts.¡±  Perhaps a more telling statement came Saturday morning, before the Texas shooting, when Willes Lee, the group¡¯s second vice president, tweeted: ¡°Where do you feel least safe, most vulnerable? Exactly. A gun free zone. Tell elected officials & business owners they are responsible for innocent people losing lives.¡± Still, gun control advocates believe the N.R.A. is in its weakest position since 1994. With Mr. Trump in the White House, the organization can no longer say that a hostile administration is threatening to take away Americans¡¯ guns.  Some prominent Republicans, including Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Marco Rubio of Florida, do support extreme-risk protection orders, commonly known as red-flag laws. This in itself is a significant shift, and in an interview earlier this year, Mr. Rubio said he had been influenced by how routine mass shootings had become. ¡°I remember being at a confirmation service for my nephew, and somehow the thought crept into my head: What if somebody walked in here now and started shooting?¡± he said. ¡°I never used to think about those things. So absolutely, it has an impact on people, and people want action.¡± After the shooting in El Paso, Mr. Graham tweeted that it was ¡°time to do more than pray,¡± but did not elaborate. For Democrats in Washington, the political winds on gun control have shifted dramatically since Sandy Hook. Of the 235 Democrats in the House now, just three received ¡°A¡± ratings from the N.R.A. last year: Representatives Sanford Bishop of Georgia, Collin Peterson of Minnesota and Henry Cuellar of Texas. Mr. Cuellar has a Democratic challenger for 2020 who has sought to make his position on gun control an issue in the primary. By contrast, in 2008, voters elected 67 Democrats with A ratings. Among Democrats, there was little appetite after the El Paso and Dayton massacres for the typical offering of thoughts and prayers for the victims.  ¡°No more thoughts and prayers,¡± Senator Kamala Harris of California wrote on Sunday in a fund-raising solicitation for three gun control groups. ¡°We need action.¡±  Reid J.

Appeals Ruling on Government Liability in 2017 Church Shooting,"The appeal comes nearly a year after a judge awarded $230 million to survivors and families of a shooting that killed 26 people in Sutherland Springs, Texas. By Glenn Thrush WASHINGTON ? The Justice Department has appealed a ruling that held federal government officials responsible for a 2017 mass shooting at a church in Texas that killed 26 people, arguing that the government should not be held liable for its failure to update the national firearms background check system. The appeal, filed on Monday in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, came nearly a year after a federal judge awarded $230 million in damages to survivors and families after holding the government 60 percent liable for the rampage at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas. In a ruling in February, Judge Xavier Rodriguez of the Federal District Court in San Antonio found that Air Force officials had failed to submit crucial records, including a domestic violence conviction by a military court, that would have prevented the killer from obtaining the semiautomatic rifle used in the shooting from a licensed gun dealer. Late last year, after an attempt at mediation with lawyers for the families of those killed and 22 others injured in the attack, the government withdrew from negotiations and decided to appeal the decision. That angered the families, their lawyers and gun control groups, who saw the case as a critical test of the Biden administration¡¯s commitment to addressing the government¡¯s responsibility to keep weapons out of the hands of mass shooters. There is ¡°no dispute that U.S. Air Force personnel failed to transmit to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System information about Kelley that would have identified him as ineligible to purchase that firearm,¡± Brian M. Boynton, head of the Justice Department¡¯s civil division, wrote in Monday¡¯s filing, referring to the gunman. ¡°But that mistake is not a legally proper basis for imposing liability on the United States,¡± he added, or for finding the Air Force ¡°more culpable for the deadly massacre than the shooter himself.¡± Jamal Alsaffar, a lawyer for the families and survivors, called the department¡¯s decision ¡°a blow¡± to nationwide gun safety efforts and a ¡°betrayal by their government.¡± Mr. Alsaffar accused the department of trying to drive a pitiless bargain in the Sutherland Springs case after agreeing to large settlements after mass shootings in Parkland, Fla., and Charleston, S.C. ¡°The families offered to settle this case for less than the judge¡¯s awards and far less than what the D.O.J. settled for in the Charleston and Parkland mass shootings, but they were rejected,¡± he said. Dena Iverson, a spokeswoman for Attorney General Merrick B. Garland, said the appeal did not foreclose the possibility of a negotiated settlement in the future. ¡°Although the formal mediation has now ended, we remain open to resolving the plaintiffs¡¯ claims through settlement and will continue our efforts to do so,¡± she said in a statement. The department, she added, will ¡°continue our efforts at an out-of-court resolution.¡± On Nov. 5, 2017, Devin Patrick Kelley, 26, opened fire on congregants gathered for Sunday services at First Baptist Church. Mr. Kelley, who died in the aftermath of the attack, served at an Air Force base in New Mexico until he was court-martialed in 2012 on charges of assaulting his wife and child. He was sentenced to 12 months¡¯ confinement and received a ¡°bad conduct¡± discharge, which should have prevented him from purchasing firearms or ammunition under federal law. The Air Force later admitted that officials had failed to enter the conviction into the federal database used to perform criminal background checks. Judge Rodriguez ordered the Air Force to pay damages to the victims for their ¡°pain and suffering, mental anguish, disfigurement, impairment and loss of companionship,¡± the judge wrote, adding that the case was ¡°unprecedented in kind and scope.¡± He added, ¡°There is no satisfying way to determine the worth of these families¡¯ pain.¡± Glenn Thrush covers the Department of Justice.

By Glenn Thrush President Biden will nominate David Chipman, an adviser to the gun control organization founded by former Representative Gabrielle Giffords, to lead the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, or A.T.F., according to two people with knowledge of the move. The appointment of Mr. Chipman, a former agent with the A.T.F. ? the embattled agency tasked with enforcing firearms laws ? comes after a wave of recent mass shootings and after weeks of pressure by the Giffords group and other organizations for Mr. Biden to pick a director. While Mr. Chipman¡¯s selection came as welcome news to gun control groups, few nominees put forward by Mr. Biden have faced steeper odds of confirmation in the Senate, although his allies think he may be able to win narrow approval given the anguish over recent massacres in Boulder, Colo., and Atlanta. Mr. Chipman's prior advocacy of an assault weapons ban and other restrictions could make it hard for him to muster the 51 votes needed for confirmation, and Senate Republicans have successfully blocked potential A.T.F. directors who were much more in line with their pro-gun base. But Mr. Biden and his allies believe they have found an ideal candidate in Mr. Chipman, a gun owner who spent 25 years with the bureau, serving on its SWAT team and working on high-profile gun trafficking cases. ¡°You know, we¡¯re fortunate that, you know, Gabby was shot with a handgun,¡± Mr. Chipman said on a podcast in 2019, discussing the 2011 attack on Ms. Giffords in which she was shot in the head and six people died. He added that she would not have survived if she had been shot by an assault rifle. The nomination is expected to be officially announced on Thursday, along with several other executive actions Mr. Biden plans to take to address the proliferation of gun violence this year. The pick ¡°is exactly what A.T.F. needs after six years without a permanent director,¡± said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, and a proponent of tighter gun regulation. The post has not been an easy one to fill. One of the main problems in picking a director, according to two gun control activists in close touch with the administration, is that potential candidates are reluctant to sign on for a nomination that is likely to go down in defeat. One high-profile figure under early consideration, Art Acevedo, the former Houston police chief, recently accepted an offer to run Miami¡¯s police department. Over the last two decades, Republicans, with the support of conservative Democrats, have embedded into spending bills riders intended to constrain the bureau, including limits on unannounced inspections of gun dealers, prohibitions on documenting the inventories of gun shops and an especially damaging provision that bars the agency from digitizing its records. In 2006, N.R.A.-allied lawmakers enacted a provision making the position of A.T.F. director, which had previously been a political appointment, subject to Senate confirmation. As a result, only one director, Obama nominee B. Todd Jones, has been confirmed over the last 15 years. Former President Donald J. Trump withdrew the nomination of a former top police union official, Chuck Canterbury, after the nominee refused to entirely rule out expanding background checks and other safeguards. The appointment was reported earlier by The Associated Press. Advertisement",NYT

Don't you tell me it's too soon to talk guns.,"Three children and three adults are dead, gunned down in a Christian elementary school in Nashville, Tenn., by a human being who had no business possessing an AR-style rifle, an AR-style pistol and another?handgun. ¡°But, but, but ¡¦ the Second Amendment,¡± some will scream, like a myopic, zombified Greek chorus. Hang your Second Amendment. It¡¯s Monday in America, there has been yet another school shooting. Children are dead. The students who weren¡¯t shot are forever changed by the trauma, and plenty more people across the country will be killed by gunfire in the days to come because, as I wrote a few words earlier, it¡¯s Monday in America, and we have a whole damn week to go. ¡°Thoughts and prayers! Don¡¯t politicize this!¡± the people will crow. Nuts to that. The thoughts-and-prayers, it¡¯s-too-soon-to-talk-about-it ship sailed several hundred mass shootings ago. I¡¯m mad now. And I¡¯m not waiting for permission to tweet or write or holler about how reckless, how ridiculous, how bloody twisted it is that we inhabit a country where people treat the tool used to murder other people in schools, in churches, in malls, at concerts, in movie theaters, on street corners and in their homes as a sacred possession that must not be regulated, that should be protected as an icon of America, like a bald eagle that spits lead. When will we act?:How many more students and teachers must die before lawmakers act to stop gun violence? Now the chorus is really riled: ¡°You can¡¯t blame the guns!¡± Like hell?I can¡¯t.? This latest?school shooter is?a 28-year-old from Nashville???who?police say had the AR-style rifle, an AR-style pistol and another?handgun???entered the Covenant School and, in short order, shot and killed three kids and three adults before being shot to death by officers. Do I blame the shooter? Of course I do. But if there¡¯s one thing I¡¯ve noticed about shootings in America, one unmistakable through line, it¡¯s the presence of one or more guns. Absent the guns that so many states have made easy-as-pie to get, these shootings would be distinctly different, in that they wouldn¡¯t be shootings.? ¡°Oh, if it wasn¡¯t a gun the killer would just use a knife or something else,¡± the chorus moans. FINE! I¡¯m happy to take that chance. A knife isn¡¯t going to do near the same damage as a pair of AR-15-style weapons in the hands of a violent person. And also: What kind of dumb argument is that? That¡¯s like saying, ¡°Well, I¡¯m not going to baby-proof these electrical outlets because my toddler could just as easily get electrocuted by walking outside and holding a metal pole in a lightning storm.¡± Maybe ? just maybe ? it¡¯s time to admit the reason this common?carnage is happening in our schools and in virtually every imaginable space in America is because we treat guns with more reverence than we treat our fellow humans' right to keep living.? Republican lawmakers continue to fight with gusto to eliminate every reasonable restriction on buying and carrying firearms, including in Tennessee where this most recent mass shooting happened. Republicans in the state have proposed expanding the concealed carry law to allow rifles rather than just handguns. Want fewer shootings?:Pass tougher gun laws. Our research shows lax laws fuel violence. Meanwhile, they¡¯re working hard to restrict things they say are harmful to children, like drag shows. Earlier this month, Tennessee became the first state to restrict public drag shows. U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene¡¯s response to the Nashville school shooting? She tweeted: ¡°How many more children have to murdered before Democrats will agree to protect children at schools the same way good guys with guns protect the President and others?¡± Yes. Battle-ready teachers are for sure the answer. Republican Sen. Rick Scott tweeted: ¡°We need to consider an automatic death penalty for school shooters. Life in prison is not enough for the deranged monsters who go into our schools to kill innocent kids & educators.¡± The Nashville shooter was shot and killed by police, Senator Einstein. What are you going to do, kill the killer twice? If the Republican Party addressed gun violence with a third the energy it puts into battling ¡°wokeness,¡± we might be able to make progress. But Republicans?won¡¯t, and we won¡¯t, at least not until people start caring enough about avoidable tragedies like the Covenant School shooting to vote for people who will end this madness. We¡¯ll learn more in the days to come about why a person decided to open fire in an elementary school in Nashville. But we already know enough, from this horrific scene and all those that came before it, to place the blame. ""Don't you jump to conclusions!,"" the chorus wails.? Nah. It's not even a jump.?It¡¯s the guns. It has always been the guns. And until we treat them like the deadly tools we know they are, it will always be the guns.

Yet it?was not even clear whether?all Democratic senators supported the legislation?? and that?remains the case in a Senate Democrats now control 51-49. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise accused Biden and Democrats of politicizing the Nashville shooting with their calls of an assault weapons ban. ¡°All they want to do is take guns away from law-abiding citizens before they even know the facts,¡± he said in a news conference Tuesday. ¡°And that¡¯s not the answer.¡± House Republicans in Tennessee remain opposed to?tighter gun regulations.?""We're not going to fix it,"" U.S. Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn.,?told reporters Monday. ""Criminals are going to be criminals."" Several Republicans expressed?greater concerns about the transgender identity of the shooting suspect, 28-year-old Audrey Hale, than the assault-style weapons used in the attack. ""If?early reports are accurate that a trans shooter targeted a Christian school, there needs to be a lot of soul searching on the extreme left,"" Sen. J.D. Vance, R-Ohio, tweeted. ""Giving in to these ideas isn't compassion, it's dangerous."" Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., called on federal law enforcement to investigate the shooting as a hate crime. ""This murderous rampage, this taking of innocent life, was a horrific crime, but more specifically, it was a hate crime,¡± he said on the House floor Tuesday. More:Andy Ogles, GOP congressman representing Nashville shooting site, criticized for posing with guns in family Christmas photo Despite long-standing disagreements on guns, a bipartisan group of lawmakers last year approved legislation after?the Uvalde and Buffalo shootings?that?? although more modest than Biden's preference???provided incentives for states to adopt red-flag gun laws and enhanced background checks on young buyers.

Since then, new data from federal prosecutors shows they¡¯ve charged 31 people in 17 cases under the new legislation. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives spokeswoman Carolyn Collins called the laws ¡°powerful new tools.¡± More:ATF director Dettelbach defends stabilizing brace rule, more at congressional hearing More:With ban on AR-15s and other rifles, Washington joins these states in prohibiting assault weapons The changes to the federal Gun Control Act ¡°are designed to enhance ATF¡¯s ability to identify, deter, and investigate those who illegally divert firearms from lawful commerce,¡± Collins wrote in an email. The first case prosecuted with the new laws was against Said Hernandez, 26, in Laredo, Texas. He began his seven-year prison term for gun trafficking this week after being arrested last summer.? Police intercepted Hernandez traveling south on Interstate 35 towards the Mexican border with 17 firearms. Charging documents show since 2020 he purchased 231 handguns in Texas in calibers of 9mm, .380 and .22 and trafficked them to Mexico.? In public announcements, the ATF warns that straw purchasing can now carry a 25-year prison sentence if the gun is used in a terrorism attack or drug trafficking. In cases reviewed by USA TODAY, defendants often plead down their charges from trafficking or straw purchasing to lesser offenses. In general, straw purchasing is when the buyer of a firearm is actually buying a gun on behalf of someone else. New laws further say it¡¯s illegal to buy for someone who is prohibited under federal law, intends to use the gun in furtherance of a felony or drug trafficking or intends to sell or dispose of the firearm to another prohibited person.? More:First federal gun crime report in 20 years shows shrinking time between firearm purchase, usage in crimes In general, gun trafficking is diversion of guns from lawful commerce into the illegal market. ?The?new legislation defines gun trafficking under a stand-alone statute that makes it illegal to ¡°ship, transport, transfer, cause to be transported, or otherwise dispose of any firearm to another person in or otherwise affecting interstate or foreign commerce, if such person knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the use, carrying, or possession of a firearm by the recipient would constitute a felony.¡± More:How guns are smuggled from state to state on the iron pipeline Earlier this year, federal agents in Las Vegas kept a watch on Adrian Quebec, 21, after he publicly posted on his Instagram account stories about the sales of several firearms. Agents used confidential informants to perform controlled buys of at least seven firearms ? including those ATF considers unserialized, privately made firearms. A criminal complaint alleges Quebec drew attention for selling handguns affixed with what the ATF describes as? ¡°machine gun conversion devices¡± or ¡°Glock switches,¡± which bypass the semi-automatic functions of a pistol to fire automatically. In November, Quebec posted on Instagram a link to a news story about police concerned about the Glock switches and appeared to taunt the government to ¡°come get¡± them. He was arrested several weeks later. Quebec entered a plea agreement this month for three years in prison. A final sentencing is set for July. Quebec¡¯s public defender declined to comment on the case. Prosecutors charged Sameka Buxton, 31, the girlfriend of Tyrin Wiltz, 28, in New Orleans with straw purchases of five firearms. Wilks has been charged with second-degree attempted murder of Joe Cooper, the husband of a well-known radio DJ. Cooper was critically injured in the home-invasion shooting, which happened in May 2022. The FBI, local police and U.S. Marshals attempted to arrest Wilks in September at his apartment. He barricaded himself, Buxton and two children in the home for nearly three hours. More:Their guns fueled Chicago crime. When they broke the law, the ATF went easy.

Buxton entered a plea agreement and is facing up to six years in prison at sentencing in June. Peter Carr, a spokesman for the Department of Justice, said gun trafficking cases are resource-intensive. ¡°By their nature, firearm-trafficking cases often involve multiple defendants whose criminal conduct crosses jurisdictional lines,¡± Carr wrote in an email. ¡°These prosecutions require not only time, training, and resources but also cooperation among different U.S. Attorneys¡¯ Offices and numerous state and local law-enforcement partners.¡± More:After repeated ATF warnings, gun dealers can count on the agency to back off; sometimes firearms flow to criminals More:'Rogue' gun dealers revealed: What to know as ATF names gun shops that flout federal laws In addition to the trafficking and straw purchasing provisions, Carr said the new law signed last year mandated enhanced background checks for buyers under 21.

""This legislation today will improve public safety and reduce gun violence,"" Colorado Gov.?Jared Polis said in a statement. The new laws increase the minimum age to purchase any firearm from 18 to 21, establish a three-day waiting period between purchasing and taking possession of a firearm and expand the state's existing red flag law.?Another aims to make it easier?for victims of gun violence to sue the gun industry. Gun rights groups filed lawsuits Friday over the new restrictions on waiting periods and minimum purchasing age. The groups cite a key Supreme Court decision last year that expanded gun rights. The legislation comes months after a 22-year-old man?fatally shot five people and wounded more than a dozen others at Club Q, an LGBTQ nightclub in Colorado Springs. Colorado Sen. Tom Sullivan, whose son was killed?in the 2012 mass shooting at?a movie theater in Aurora, sponsored two of the bills. Earlier this month, the governor of Michigan?signed legislation aimed at preventing gun violence after a mass shooting at Michigan State University left three people dead and five injured. In Tennessee, the governor signed an executive order aimed at strengthening background checks for firearm purchases after a mass shooting at a private Christian school in Nashville killed three children and three staff members. Meanwhile, Washington this week became the tenth state to ban some so-called ""assault weapons."" The state's ban specifically applies to military-style semiautomatic weapons, including AR- and AK-style firearms. Illinois adopted a similar ban earlier this year, after the mass shooting at a Fourth of July parade?in Highland Park.",USA

The Tennessee Firearms Association and the National Police Association are suing Nashville Police and the Tennessee Star filed an administrative appeal with the FBI. All three received almost identical denials of their requests for the materials, citing a Tennessee rule shielding records from public release if they are part of an ongoing criminal prosecution. But those seeking the materials maintain there is no ongoing criminal prosecution related to the shooting. Police fatally shot the gunman, later identified as 28-year-old Audrey Hale. Hale killed six people at Covenant elementary school?in March. Hale, a former student at the school, had two semi-automatic, assault-style rifles and a handgun and gunned down three young students and three staff members before being confronted by Nashville police. Calls for the release of the materials Hale left behind ? which Tennessee Bureau of Investigations Director David Rausch characterized more as ""ramblings"" rather than writings pointing to any clear motive ? have been growing over the past few weeks, heightened by Gov. Bill Lee¡¯s statement on social media April 27 declaring that the information would be ¡°released to the public very soon,¡± as well as his calls for a special session to pass his proposed gun control legislation. The Tennessean has also requested the information and is pushing for its release. On Wednesday, Nashville police blamed the litigation for delaying release of the materials. ""Due to pending litigation filed this week, the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department has been advised by counsel to hold in abeyance the release of records related to the shooting at The Covenant School pending orders or direction of the court,"" the department posted on Twitter. Nashville lawyer Wally Dietz said in a statement Wednesday that the city is asking the court to give victims' families a chance to appear and raise concerns or objections about the release of the writings. The city wrote in a filing Wednesday that ""some parents from The Covenant School have informally indicated to the (police department) that they oppose the release of the shooter¡¯s writings."" Dietz said the litigation seeks ""voluminous documents."" ""We plan to file under seal the entire journal found in the shooter's car in the parking lot at The Covenant School together with our proposed redactions, under the Public Records Act, for the Court to review for release."" The city was asking the court to reschedule a hearing May 11 about releasing the records. The city said that timeline was not feasible given the volume of materials, which included items other than Hale's journal. In addition, the city said Nashville police has ""not had an opportunity to interview everyone related to the incident and review all the documents it has gathered"" and postponing the hearing would give interested parties a chance to weigh in. ""The Metropolitan Government believes they should have an opportunity to participate in the show cause hearing if they wish and that the Court should consider these varying interests,"" Metro wrote in its filing.

Radio Television of Serbia said a suspect, identified by the initials U.B., was arrested near the central Serbian town of Kragujevac. Serbia's interior ministry said the arrest came after an ""extensive search."" Mass shootings are extremely rare in Serbia, which has strict gun laws. But the western Balkan country has one of the highest rates of gun ownership in Europe ? 39.1 firearms per 100 people, according to the Small Arms Survey, a Geneva-based organization. The U.S. has the highest, with 120.5 guns per 100 people. The western Balkans also have an entrenched gun culture, a legacy of the 1990s wars, which left the region awash with guns. Thursday's shooting came after a 13-year-old boy used his father's guns in a rampage at a school in Belgrade on Wednesday that killed eight of his fellow students and a school guard. The incident sent shockwaves through a nation unused to mass murders. The last mass shooting before this week was in 2016, when a man motivated by jealousy shot dead five people, including his wife, and injured another 20 at a Serbian cafe. Thursday's incident came as authorities moved to tighten Serbia's gun laws in the wake of the shooting earlier in the week. A government proposal included imposing a two-year moratorium on issuing permits for small firearms and a pledge to review all existing weapons permits within three months.

https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/05/07/allen-texas-mass-shooting-live-updates/70192152007/,2023-05-08,Authorities investigate whether Texas mall shooter was motivated by ideology: Updates,"ALLEN, Texas ? Authorities are looking into whether the gunman who killed eight people at a suburban Dallas outdoor mall showed an interest in white supremacist and neo-Nazi views, and if those provided a motive for the weekend attack, The Associated Press and CNN reported Sunday. While cautioning that the investigation has just begun, law enforcement sources told the outlets that Mauricio Garcia, identified as the gunman, had links to that ideology. Those included social media accounts and posts as well as a patch on his chest that read ¡°RWDS,¡± an acronym for the phrase ¡°Right Wing Death Squad,¡± which is popular among right-wing extremists and white supremacy groups. Garcia, 33, was killed by police responding to Saturday's assault, which left seven people with injuries that required hospitalization. In addition to reviewing Garcia's electronic media presence, federal agents have interviewed family members and associates of Garcia to ask about his ideological beliefs and are reviewing his financial records said an official, who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity. Authorities were picking through shattered glass and shell casings Sunday at the mall in Allen, a city of 105,000 residents about 25 miles north of Dallas. Amid the chaos as hundreds of shoppers at Allen Premium Outlets scrambled for cover Saturday, a police officer on an unrelated call heard the gunshots and raced to the scene, Allen Police Chief Brian Harvey said. ""He heard gunshots, located the gunshots, located the shooter, neutralized the shooter, neutralized the threat,"" Harvey said at a briefing late Saturday. Three law enforcement officials who requested anonymity to discuss details of an ongoing investigation identified the shooter as Garcia, AP reported. One of the officials said Garcia had been staying at a nearby motel. The official said investigators have been searching the motel and a home in the Dallas area connected to the suspect. Authorities have not released information on a possible motive or details about the victims, including their names. President Joe Biden tweeted Sunday that the assailant wore tactical gear and was armed with an AR-15-style rifle. He thanked first responders who acted ""quickly and courageously"" but said such attacks had become shockingly familiar. ""Once again, Congress must send me a bill banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines,"" Biden wrote. ""Enacting universal background checks. Requiring safe storage. Ending immunity for gun manufacturers. I will sign it immediately. We need nothing less to keep our streets safe."" Texas Gov. Greg Abbott dismissed gun control legislation as a ""quick solution"" that won't solve the problem, telling ""Fox News Sunday"" that addressing mental health issues is the long-term solution. Six victims and the gunman died at the scene, Allen Fire Chief Jonathan Boyd said. Nine people were transported to regional hospitals, where two died a short time later, police said. Three people remained hospitalized in critical condition Sunday and four were in fair condition. Developments: ? Harvey said he believed the shooter acted alone and asked that anyone who witnessed the attacks or had video from the scene contact police. ? Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro?Mayorkas described the shooting as ""another horrific tragedy in our country."" Mayorkas, speaking on ""Face the Nation,"" said he spoke with the governor and mayor and that state and local authorities were leading the investigation. ? Biden ordered flags flown at half-staff until May 11.? Steven Spainhouer said he raced to the scene after his son called from the mall to say shots were being fired. Spainhouer told CBS News he arrived before any first responders, and while a handful of people around him were recording videos, he tried to save lives.?Some were so badly hurt they had to be loaded into police cars because ambulances would not have arrived fast enough. ""I was on the phone with 911 and I was telling them we have a mass casualty incident,"" he said. ""The first girl I walked up to was crouched down covering her head in the bushes, so I felt for a pulse, pulled her head to the side and she had no face."" Katie Shi, who lives with her husband and two children in Allen about a mile away from the scene, said the outdoor outlet mall is a frequent go-to place for her family. They had just purchased a pair of shoes for her 7-year-old son at the Nike outlet, she said Sunday. On Saturday afternoon, Shi, 39, had been out running errands when she passed the mall on the way home and noticed the heavy police presence. By the time she got home to her relieved husband, the shooting was all over the news and there were helicopters in the skies overhead. While Shi and her family are safe, it¡¯s still scary, she said, not to know whether any of her children¡¯s classmates may have been affected. ""Having it happen in your hometown, where you go to church, where your kids go to school, where you do your shopping ? it takes your sense of safety away,"" she said. Shi says she knows the gun issue can be polarizing, but she finds it bewildering that after so many mass shootings in the U.S., ""life just keeps going and we don¡¯t pause to say, 'Let¡¯s do something.' ?No one needs to have semi-automatic weapons."" The attack continues a troubling trend of mass shootings across the nation and in Texas. It comes a week after a gunman opened fire on neighbors in Cleveland, Texas, killing five people including a 9-year-old boy. Last May, a gunman in Uvalde, Texas, shot his grandmother before driving to an elementary and opening fire, killing 19 students and two teachers before being killed by police. James Alan Fox, a professor of Criminology, Law, and Public Policy at Northeastern University who has studied mass killings for 40 years, says 2023 has been the worst year in terms of mass killings ""since at least 2006 and probably ever."" ""I've not seen anything like this,"" Fox said. ""We have more guns in the hands of Americans. Gun sales have skyrocketed since COVID. There's a lot of divisiveness in this country, and people suffering emotionally and economically since the pandemic."" The shooting brought the customary statements of sympathy and support from federal, state, and local officials. Mayor Ken Fulk issued a statement promising full support to families of the victims. He said Allen is a ""proud and safe city,"" making the attack more shocking. ""We are a strong and caring community,"" Fulk said. ""We want all of the victims and their families impacted by this tragedy to know that we will wrap our arms around you, and we are here for you."" Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, a Republican,?said he and wife Heidi were ""praying for the victims."" Abbott, who like Cruz has consistently supported easing gun restrictions, pledged to ensure ""all needed assistance and resources"" would be swiftly deployed. ¡°Our hearts are with the people of Allen, Texas tonight during this unspeakable tragedy,¡± Abbott said in a statement.? Rep. Keith Self, a Republican who represents the congressional district where Allen is located, tweeted a statement Saturday offering prayers to the victims, their families and law enforcement. Told later in a CNN interview that many believe prayers aren't working, Self responded: ""Well, those are people that don't believe in an almighty God who has, who is absolutely in control of our lives. I'm a Christian. I believe that he is.'' Texas state Sen. Roland Gutierrez, a Democrat who represents Uvalde, took aim on social media at lawmakers who resist gun reform. ""There is a special place in hell for people who watch all this happen and choose to do nothing. #bloodontheirhands,"" he tweeted. Police and witnesses said a gunman parked a gray Honda Accord outside the mall at around 3:30 p.m. Saturday. The man began shooting people walking on sidewalks outside the mall, a popular shopping spot with many upscale outlets such as Brooks Brothers, Calvin Klein and Ann Taylor. Dashcam video circulating online showed the gunman getting out of a car and starting to shoot. More than three dozen shots could be heard as the vehicle recording the video drove away. Pretzel stand employee Maxwell Gum, 16, described a stampede of shoppers as he and others sheltered in a storage room. ""We started running. Kids were getting trampled,"" Gum said. ""My co-worker picked up a 4-year-old girl and gave her to her parents."" Fontayne Payton, 35, was at H&M when he heard gunshots through his headphones. People in the store ushered a group into the fitting rooms and then a lockable back room, he said. When they were given the all-clear to leave, Payton saw the store had broken windows and a trail of blood to the door. Outside, Payton saw bodies. ""I pray it wasn¡¯t kids, but it looked like kids,"" he said. ""It broke me when I walked out to see that."" Witnesses told WFAA-TV the shooter was dressed in all black. They said the shooting took place near Fatburger restaurant and in front of the H&M outlet. H&M issued a statement saying all its employees were safe and that counseling will be provided to any who request it. Max Weiss, 18, told CNN he was working in the mall when he heard gunshots for as long as three minutes.?He said he and other employees and customers locked the front door to the store and huddled in the stock room. He described the scene as ¡°anxious, tense and terrifying"" and said the group waited nearly two hours for officers to come into the store and escort them out of the parking lot area with their arms in the air. Mass killings are happening with staggering frequency in the United States this year: an average of about one a week, according to?an analysis of The Associated Press/USA TODAY/Northeastern University mass killing database.?So far there have been 22 mass killings in the U.S. in 2023. The Gun Violence Archive says the Texas mass shooting is the 200th?in the nation this year and the 12th in May. Mass shootings, defined as four or more people shot, differ from mass killings, defined as four or more people killed. Contributing: The Associated Press",USA

Several Uvalde victims' relatives burst into sobs and cheers in the Capitol hearing room when two Republicans joined all the Democrats on the committee to advance the bill by an 8-5 vote. ¡°I'm feeling very overwhelmed, very emotional,¡± Kimberly Garcia said through tears after the committee vote. Her 10-year-old daughter, Amerie Jo Garza, was one of the 19 fourth graders and two teachers killed at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde on May 24, 2022. ¡°I was super worried, but I feel like my daughter did this, and I feel like she's making a difference, and I'm proud of her. I hate that it's come down to this, but I know that she's always with me, and I know that I'm not going to let anyone ever forget her,"" Garcia said. Uvalde victims' relatives have been advocating for lawmakers to pass House Bill 2744 for months, coming to the Capitol nearly every week during the legislative session to demand its passage and even waiting more than 13 hours to testify in support of the bill in a committee hearing in April. Their unrelenting push for lawmakers to pass gun control legislation has been an uphill battle in a Republican-dominated Legislature that has loosened gun restrictions in recent sessions. Monday¡¯s vote, however, was a significant victory for the families.? As recently as 10 a.m. Monday, Rio Grande City Republican Rep. Ryan Guillen, who chairs the committee where the bill was pending, had said he was not planning to bring the bill up for a vote because he didn¡¯t believe it had the votes to pass in the full House.? But by 11 a.m., after an emotional protest and news conference by the Uvalde families and gun control activists Monday, Guillen changed course. The Uvalde gunman purchased his AR-15 style semi-automatic rifle legally just days after his 18th birthday, having unsuccessfully tried to acquire one before he was legally old enough to do so under state law.? While Monday¡¯s progress was a major, and unexpected, step forward, the future of the bill remains uncertain. Texas House Speaker Dade Phelan previously said he would be willing to let a debate on the bill play out on the House floor but cautioned that he doesn¡¯t believe it has the votes to pass the House. Gov. Greg Abbott has said he believes the measure to be unconstitutional.

Now he's going to prison for 14 years.,"A Jackson, Mississippi, man was sentenced to 14 years in federal prison for illegally manufacturing machine guns using 3D printers, according to the Justice Department. Kent Edward Newhouse, 41, already had a felony conviction, making it illegal for him to have firearms. In 2022, he illegally possessed firearms and used 3D printers to manufacture a firearms component called an ""auto sear,"" which turns a semi-automatic firearm into a fully automatic machine gun, the Justice Department said Thursday. Federal law designates auto sears as machine guns themselves. ""On July 13, 2022, Newhouse sold a confidential informant a firearm and several auto-sears,"" the DOJ said in a statement. Newhouse pleaded guilty to two counts of being a felon in possession of a firearm and one count of engaging in business as a manufacturer of firearms in September. NEW GUN LAWSDOJ's gun control effort showing progress on straw purchases, gun trafficking The auto sears Newhouse 3D printed are a type of conversion device that makes semi-automatic firearms act like machine guns that fire rapidly without the need to repeatedly pull a trigger. They're tiny metal or plastic pieces, the size of a dime, and quickly attached to the back of a semi-automatic. Auto sears have been turning up more often in places like Louisville, Kentucky, the USA TODAY Network's Courier Journal reported. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives reported 120 of the devices were confiscated in the city in the first nine months of 2022, compared to about a dozen in 2021 and none in 2020. In the nation's capital, police told The Washington Post that guns with auto sears were being recovered more frequently in 2021; police seized 20 that year, double what they recovered in 2020. ¡°The use of 3D printers to unlawfully manufacture firearms, and to make devices to convert semiautomatic firearms into machine guns, poses a real and current threat to our communities,"" Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives Special Agent in Charge Kurt Thielhorn said when Newhouse pleaded guilty. Congressional Democrats last month reintroduced legislation they hope will help authorities prevent the importation and trafficking of conversion devices such as auto sears and report data about auto sears in federal firearms tracking reports. ¡°Gun conversion devices can turn ordinary handguns into deadly automatic weapons in less than a minute. As we grapple with the epidemic of gun violence in this country, virtually unfettered access to these types of deadly firearms is exactly what we do not need,¡±?New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a cosponsor of the Preventing Illegal Weapons Trafficking Act of 2023, said in a statement on Monday.

https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/05/14/buffalo-tops-shooting-ruth-whitfields-son-has-embraced-activism/70211943007/,2023-05-14,His mother was killed in Buffalo's racist shooting. How he has turned grief into activism,"Garnell Whitfield Jr.'s mother, had she not been gunned down by a white supremacist a year ago, would be 87. Whitfield, a man of unbending faith, sees a powerful harmony with the fact that the birthday of his mother, Ruth Whitfield, this year would have fallen on the Good Friday date of April 7, for Christians like him a day of death followed by rebirth. Similarly, he sees that same harmony with the May 14 anniversary of the murder of his mother and nine other Black people at the Tops supermarket: That day is also Mother's Day. ""The real story is (Christ's) resurrection, and it's my mother's story,"" Whitfield said in an interview this month at his Buffalo home. ""That's my mother's story because my mother is bigger now than she ever would have been. My mother is bigger than life. My mother has influence and power in death that she never had."" In the aftermath of Ruth Whitfield's murder, her family has become outspoken advocates of policy and community changes, especially her son Garnell Whitfield Jr., Buffalo's former fire commissioner. They are among the families of the 10 who were murdered who are now trying to bring a spotlight to the societal and racial underpinnings of the murder. And then there is the grief to navigate on the anniversary of the killings. Whitfield himself has addressed Congress about proposed gun control measures. He has marched with the victims of other of mass killings. The Whitfield family organized an April conference at the University of Buffalo that attracted national social justice activists and focused on issues from gun violence to the oppressive presence of white supremacy. Ruth Whitfield's photo was prominently displayed at the conference, and her name highlighted in the conference's title, ""Pursuit of Truth."" ""In the Jewish tradition, when someone passes we say, 'May their memory be for a blessing,'"" said Amy Spitalnick, an expert in online radicalization and a speaker at the conference. ""The Whitfield family has certainly turned their grief into action and their mother's memory into a blessing through their extraordinary activism and leadership. The conference last month is a model for the community conversations and partnerships we need in order to break the stranglehold of violent white supremacy and extremism."" Wherever he is, Garnell Whitfield Jr. said, his mother is alongside. ""She's always with me,"" he said. ""My mom is always with me, just as our Lord Savior is always with me. My mom poured herself into me. ... I'm an extension of her."" These families have a road map for those in Buffalo, Uvalde. They've been there. 'The pain is real.' Buffalonians push on through fire, ice and grief Though in incessant pain from back ailments and other physical maladies, Ruth Whitfield weathered through, often providing an ear and a heart to others in need. For a decade she visited her husband daily at a nearby nursing home where he resided. Her husband had suffered a traumatic brain injury, was unable to speak and sometimes did not recognize those around him. She did not miss a visit. This month at the Tops where his mother was killed, Garnell Whitfield Jr. met for the first time a supermarket manager who often confided in Ruth Whitfield about his personal struggles, and she always responded with an encouraging word that gave him a boost. The manager had a similar conversation in Tops only 20 minutes before Ruth Whitfield was murdered. In tears, he told Garnell Whitfield Jr. of the exchange. ""What we find out is that my mother was much bigger, though she was the biggest thing in my life, she was much bigger than that to other people,"" Whitfield said. For Garnell Whitfield Jr., it would be wrong to write off the Tops murderer, as a lone wolf whose crimes were an act of violence in isolation. When speaking of the shooter, Whitfield never mentions his name, instead calling him the ""murderer"" or ""perpetrator."" Ruth Whitfield's death is a tragic consequence of the racism that infected the 18-year-old gunman and motivated him to target a supermarket in a predominantly Black neighborhood so he could kill as many Black people as possible. He was inspired by the once fringe ""replacement theory,"" a claim that there is a concerted effort to replace white people with people of color, including immigrants. Before May 14, the belief slithered into mainstream media, most notably embraced by former Fox commentator Tucker Carlson. The Buffalo shooter found many like minds on social media platforms and was encouraged and energized by others who shared his racism, Whitfield said. That racism, for Whitfield, cannot be separated from the country's brutal enslavement of Black people, from the centuries of denial of basic human rights, from the community redlining and educational deprivations that barricaded Black families from the generational wealth so common among the nation's white residents. ""All of these things are being manipulated ¡¦ by white supremacists, people who do not believe in justice, do not believe in equity,"" he said. Ruth Whitfield ensured that her family knew their heritage as Black Americans. ""To those people who do not see us, how dare you not see us as Americans?"" her son, Raymond Whitfield, said after the murders. ""?We stand among the blood and the sweat and the tears of our ancestors. She taught us to be proud of that fact. ""She was unapologetically an African American princess,"" he said. Garnell Whitfield Jr., who also served as an assistant commissioner of the state's homeland security division, said he faced daily racism as he rose through the ranks of Buffalo's fire services. ""There was not a day that I did not have to deal with people, people that were under me ¡¦ that did not think they should be answering to me only because I was Black, for no other reason,"" Whitfield said. ""George Floyd was a watershed moment ... in our lives but, for me, when I saw what happened, when I saw how he died, I believe it was like an epiphany."" When he watched the video of the Minneapolis police officer who murdered Floyd, a Black man, by kneeling on his neck for nearly nine minutes, Whitfield said what he saw was far more than the asphyxiation of a single man. ""It was the first time I understood what was wrong with me,"" Whitfield said. ""My whole life I've had somebody on my neck and can't take a full breath. That's how it feels ? the weight of racism, of discrimination, of hate, wearing it, carrying it. I finally understood what it was I felt my whole life when I saw him take his last breath."" Still, Whitfield said, his faith and the ever-present memories of the words and soul of his mother allow him to persist, with hope and with a belief that there can be change. ""At the end of the day, it's how you feel about me and how I feel about you. Do I see you as a fellow human being, as a creation of God? Do I see you as a brother or a sister who God saw fit to breathe the breath of life into? ""We can have these conversations and I think that change occurs."" That is what Ruth Whitfield believed, and it was the fiber of her constant strength, decency and goodness. The perpetrator could not diminish that for those who loved her. ""My mom's physically gone, but spiritually she's ever present, and I'm thankful to God for that,"" Garnell Whitfield Jr. said. ""As difficult as this has been, I talk with my mom every day.""

Biden, who has failed to convince a divided Congress to pass major national gun reform, said in a Sunday op-ed in USA TODAY that he will call for states to enact laws that provide the federal background check system ""access to all records that could prohibit someone under age 21 from purchasing a firearm."" This move and other steps announced in the op-ed coincide with the one-year anniversary of a mass shooting in Buffalo, N.Y. in which a white 19-year-old gunman killed 10 Black people at a supermarket. Several measures build off the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act - a gun law with limited restrictions that Congress passed last year - and a March 14 executive order Biden signed that seeks to increase the number of background checks during gun purchases. ""America doesn¡¯t have to be a place where our children learn how to duck and cover from a shooter, or scan a movie theater or restaurant for their exit options,"" Biden wrote. In the one year since the Buffalo shooting, Biden has been forced to confront mass shootings in Uvalde, Texas; Monterey Park, Calif.; Michigan State University; Nashville, Tenn.; Louisville, Ky.; Dadeville Ala.; and most recently, Allen Texas, among many other places. Biden has repeatedly renewed his call for Congress to reinstate a federal ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, but he's been unable to sway Republicans in Congress to support that. He has also unsuccessfully pushed for legislation for universal gun background checks. Following the Buffalo and Uvalde shootings, Congress passed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which provided grants for states that adopt ""red flag"" laws, which allow courts to remove firearms from those deemed a threat to themselves or others. But the law didn't go nearly as far as gun control advocates want. In March Biden said he had exhausted the ""full extent of my executive authority"" on guns as he called on Congress to act in the aftermath of a shooting at Christian private school in Nashville that month that killed seven people, including three children. ""Gun violence is mobilizing an entire generation of young people. But we cannot sit back and pass this problem off to the next generation to solve,"" Biden said in the op-ed Sunday. ""If we wait, too many of them will never have the chance to grow up."" Biden concluded with a message to Congress: ""For God's sake, do something.""

President Joe Biden is calling on state lawmakers to strengthen gun laws to help combat mass shootings. Let's get into what he said. In a USA TODAY op-ed published yesterday, Biden said he will urge governors and other state lawmakers to strengthen gun background checks on buyers under 21 years old and enact laws that would give the federal background check system ""access to all records that could prohibit someone under age 21 from purchasing a firearm."" Biden's comments coincide with the one-year anniversary of a mass shooting in Buffalo, N.Y., where a white 19-year-old gunman killed 10 Black people at a supermarket. What this means: Biden is turning to the state level and officials to address mass shootings after failing to get Congress to pass major federal gun reform. Why is this important?: In the year since the mass shooting in Buffalo, N.Y., Biden has been forced to confront mass shootings in Uvalde, Texas; Monterey Park, Calif.; Michigan State University; Nashville, Tenn.; Louisville, Ky.; Dadeville Ala.; and most recently, Allen, Texas, among many other places, reporter Joey Garrison writes. Bottom line: This is Biden's latest move to try and combat mass shootings as his repeated calls for Congress to reinstate a federal ban on assault weapons has gone nowhere. Biden says he has exhausted the ""full extent of my executive authority"" on gun control reform. ???????

Santos pleaded not guilty to the charges and vowed to ""fight the witch hunt"" and clear his name, but his fellow House representatives aren't making that easy. ""Kick him out! He¡¯s gotta go!¡± Bowman yelled as reporters tried to interview Santos outside the Capitol. He continued to shout over the media's questions, urging Santos to resign and ""have some dignity."" ""New Yorkers need better,"" Bowman belted out above the mix of journalists pushing microphones and cellphones in front of Santos. Meanwhile, Ocasio-Cortez was telling Santos, ¡°You gotta go. You gotta give it up."" Previous coverage:Rep. George Santos pleads not guilty to 13 counts including fraud, lying to Congress ""I can¡¯t continue to address you guys because there¡¯s a deranged member here, so I¡¯m gonna walk,"" he said.

Greene ? who has introduced articles of impeachment this week against U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Matthew Graves, FBI director Christopher Wray, Attorney General Merrick Garland and Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas ? soon began chanting to ""impeach Biden."" Bowman told her the Republican Party is ""hanging by a thread"" and implored her to ""save the party."" ""No more QAnon, no more MAGA, no more debt ceiling nonsense,"" he said. Bowman told her to do something about guns, and Greene told him to close the border. Earlier this year, Bowman got into a shouting match inside the Capitol with Rep.

A teenager was arrested Friday afternoon after he brought an AR-15 rifle to school with extra ammunition in his backpack and lunch box, police said. Phoenix police officers said they responded to Bostrom High School in Maryvale just before 1 p.m., where they found the student with the AR-15 semi-automatic rifle and ammunition. Officers arrested the teenage boy, who wasn't identified by authorities, at the school's main office under multiple ""serious felony charges,"" police said. The principal said in statement that administration learned about a possible weapon on campus at lunch and placed the school on lockdown. The campus will have additional safety measures in place on Monday ""out of an abundance of caution,"" Principal Michelle Gutierrez de Jimenez said. Bostrom is an alternative high school with a small learning environment, according to the Phoenix Union High School District website.

""We commend those who originally reported the possibility of a weapon on school grounds to adults on campus who immediately called police,"" police said in a statement released Friday. At least nine states have banned sales of an array of semi-automatic weapons, including AR-15s, that have become known for their use in some of the deadliest mass shootings in the country. The rifles are semi-automatic because they fire one bullet per pull of the trigger and automatically reload for another shot. A fully automatic weapon would continuously fire as long as the trigger is pulled until the supply of ammunition runs out. Minors in Arizona are not permitted to have firearms except in certain circumstances, and all firearms are outlawed on school property except by those authorized to have them, according to the Giffords Law Center, which advocates for gun control laws and tracks existing laws.",USA

If anything, they¡¯ve ramped up and I know I¡¯m more hyper aware after my incident, but it literally feels like every second of the day ... you¡¯re seeing another person dying of guns.¡± There have been at least 236 mass shootings in the country so far this year, leaving 306 individuals dead and 938 injured, according to the Gun Violence Archive, a nonprofit publicly sourced database that defines a mass shooting as at least four people struck by gunfire. Despite the nation¡¯s growing epidemic of gun violence and mass shootings, Congress has been slow to act ? only passing the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the largest gun bill in three decades, last June after two deadly mass shootings. Now, days after the nation¡¯s latest mass shooting at a?suburban Texas outdoor mall and upon the first anniversary of the Robb Elementary School shooting in Uvalde, Texas ? the second deadliest school shooting in the country¡¯s history ? some House Republicans are pushing legislation to repeal all recent bipartisan gun control measures. President Biden:I¡¯m doing everything I can to reduce gun violence, but Congress must do more Nearly two years ago, Fleming was struck by two bullets ? one piercing her lung, the other grazing her liver ? in a drive-by shooting that left her in the hospital for two weeks. The shooting happened on her way to meet a friend for dinner, walking along a route she routinely traveled to Columbia Heights in Washington, D.C. The 30-year-old was already a supporter of stronger gun restrictions. But after being shot, she developed a sense of urgency around gun control legislation she hadn't previously felt. ¡°I think it¡¯s very common to think ¡®Oh it¡¯s never going to happen to me¡¯ and ¡®This is a problem happening elsewhere,¡¯¡± Fleming said. Over 48,000 people died from gun-related injuries in 2021 ? a 23% increase from the roughly 39,000 deaths in 2019, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The number of gun murders has also grown since 2019, accounting for nearly 21,000 of those gun-related injury deaths in 2021 ? a 45% increase. For Fleming, those statistics only reinforce the concerns she has had since having two bullets strike her chest. ¡°It¡¯s hard to grapple with like the fact of feeling safe ever again,¡± she added. ¡°Unfortunately, I think that¡¯s a feeling that a lot of Americans are feeling.¡± More than 80% of adults say they¡¯ve taken at least one precaution to protect themselves or their families from the possibility of gun violence, including avoiding large crowds and public transportation, according to recent polling from KFF, a nonpartisan nonprofit focused on health policy. More:Dave Matthews doesn't want to be afraid of 'my children being murdered at school' The survey ? conducted from March 14-23 ? also found that 51% of adults considered gun-related crimes, injuries and deaths a ¡°constant threat¡± or a ¡°major concern but not a constant threat¡± in their local communities. Efforts by Democrats in Congress to pass gun legislation has stalled since the passage of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which followed the deadly mass shooting in Buffalo, New York, where a white gunman killed 10 Black people at a supermarket. The Uvalde massacre, in which a former student allegedly killed 19 children and two teachers, came just 10 days after that. Days after the May 6 mass shooting in Allen, Texas, Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado introduced a bill to repeal all ¡°gun control provisions and every Second Amendment Infringement¡± passed from early 2021 to early 2023 and signed into law by President Joe Biden. ¡°I unapologetically support the Second Amendment,"" Boebert said in a statement, calling gun control measures ""nonsense"" and saying she will ""stand for law-abiding Americans and the Constitution.¡± The bill ? the Shall Not be Infringed Act ? would target provisions in several pieces of legislation, including the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which earned the support of 15 Republican senators. ? The bipartisan legislation expanded background checks on gun buyers under 21 to include their mental health and juvenile justice records. It also imposed a required waiting period of 10 business days for the seller and authorities to complete the review, in addition to incentivizing states to pass red flag laws. All of those changes would be rescinded under the Colorado lawmaker¡¯s bill. ? ¡°It¡¯s a complete slap in the face to all the victims and families who¡¯ve lost loved ones, and not just them. It¡¯s a slap in the face of the entire country,¡± Rep. Maxwell Frost, D-Fla., told USA TODAY. ¡°The majority of Americans want common sense gun reform. The majority of Republicans want common sense gun reform.¡± Frost, a staunch advocate for gun restrictions, has been a leader in the effort to end gun violence since the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012. The Florida Democrat also served as the first national organization director for March for Our Lives after the Parkland high school shooting in 2018. In remarks at the White House on Wednesday, the one-year anniversary of the Uvalde shooting, Biden said the previous, bipartisan law is ""not nearly enough"" and called on Congress to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. ""We know that one year later, it's still so raw for you. A year of missed birthdays and holidays, school plays and soccer games. Just that smile. A year of every day joys gone forever,"" Biden said. Sixteen House Republicans cosponsored Boebert¡¯s proposed bill, including Reps. Paul Gosar of Arizona, Byron Donalds of Florida and Troy Nehls of Texas. Measures in the 2023 Appropriations Omnibus bill, the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2023 and the 2023 National Defense Authorization Act would also be at risk under the proposed bill. That includes the 14.1% budget increase for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to fortify efforts to prevent and respond to gun violence. While Boebert's bill is unlikely to become law or even go to the floor for a vote in the Democratic-controlled Senate, it's disheartening to those like Fleming.

Today marks one year since the deadly school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, in which 19 children and two teachers were killed. And while Congress passed the largest gun reform bill in three decades in the weeks following the massacre ? the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act ? not much has changed since. Now, some House Republicans are pushing to repeal measures from the landmark legislation and other additional measures. What is the Shall Not be Infringed Act?: Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado introduced the bill to repeal all ¡°gun control provisions and every Second Amendment Infringement¡± passed from early 2021 to early 2023 and signed into law by President Joe Biden. Why it matters: The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act expanded background checks on gun buyers younger than 21 to include their mental health and juvenile justice records and added required waiting period of 10 business days for the seller and authorities to complete the review, in addition to incentivizing states to pass red flag laws. It would all be rescinded under the bill. ????¡Î? Keep reading:'Just so scary': As mass shootings increase, House GOP wants to repeal bipartisan gun laws ?

It's a question floated after every school shooting that gets national attention: Would armed teachers be able to stop a mass shooter in their tracks, possibly saving many lives? There have been at least 24 shooting incidents on school campuses resulting in injury or death so far in 2023, according to a tracker by Education Week. Last week, the country marked one year since 19 students and two teachers were gunned down at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, marking the deadliest school shooting in the country since the Sandy Hook Elementary shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, nearly a decade prior. One in 5 teachers surveyed about school safety by the nonprofit, nonpartisan RAND Corp. said they feel schools would be safer if teachers were allowed to be armed. The majority, 54%, thought schools would be made less safe if teachers could carry, and another 26% said they didn't think it would make a difference in school safety. Gun rights or gun control?Is stopping gun violence more important than gun rights? Most Americans say yes, poll shows. Still, most teachers said active shooters weren't their No. 1 safety concern in the classroom. Here's what teachers think about safety in schools, according to the survey, conducted between Oct. 25 and Nov. 14, 2022, and released on Wednesday: The percentage of teachers who said they were strongly opposed to policies allowing teachers to carry guns on campus, 44%, was far higher than the percentage who said they strongly support them, 6%, the survey found. While about 20% of the 973 teachers of kindergarten through 12th grade surveyed said they thought schools would be safer if they were allowed to carry guns on campus, 19% said they would personally be interested in carrying a gun at school. That amounts to about 550,000 teachers nationwide who would want to carry on campus, the report authors estimated based on a nationwide teacher population of about 3 million. Hoax shooting school caused chaos.Then a cop mistakenly fired a gun. It is legal for teachers to carry guns on school campuses in at least 27 states, with special permissions or in certain circumstances in some states, according to the pro-gun-control Giffords Law Center. The first of those states to pass a law allowing it was South Dakota in 2013, shortly after the Sandy Hook shooting in Connecticut and the National Rifle Association proposed allowing school personnel to carry, The New York Times reported at the time. How teachers viewed guns' role in on-campus safety was influenced by their own demographic factors and those of the school communities they worked in, study results showed. White teachers were more likely than Black teachers to say they thought teacher-carry policies would make schools safer; 21% of white teachers and just 9% of Black teachers said so in the study. Among Hispanic teachers, 15% also said teacher carry would make campuses safer. More:Teachers across US question profession, gun laws after Texas school shooting Broken down by school location, teachers who taught in schools in rural areas were also more likely to agree that teacher-carry policies would help school safety. Thirty percent of rural teachers thought so, while 16% of urban and 15% of suburban teachers agreed. When asked about whether they would personally like to carry a gun at school, male teachers (27%) were more likely than female teachers (17%) to say they would. Just 5% reported that school shootings were their top safety concern. Top concerns from teachers were bullying and cyberbullying, 49%; drugs, 25%; and student fights, 17%. Their concerns varied by the age of the students taught. Middle school teachers also said self-harm was a top concern, and elementary teachers were concerned about violence against teachers by students. ""Despite the prevalence of anti-bullying programs, everyday school violence is a concern for teachers,"" said report author Heather L. Schwartz, senior policy researcher at RAND. ""Bullying, not active shooters, was teachers¡¯ most common top safety concern, followed by fights and drugs.¡± Teachers also said threats made against schools through social media caused significant disruption to education. More than one-third of the teachers surveyed, 35%, said their schools had been disrupted at least once in the 2021-22 school year by threats, which included shooting and other threats. EdWeek found that there have been 24 school shooting incidents with injuries or deaths so far this year, and 168 since 2018.

""It is time for a new generational leader,"" the 51-year-old former South Carolina governor and United Nations ambassador said during a CNN town hall in Des Moines, Iowa. ""It is time for us to leave the baggage of the past."" While Haley trails Trump and Ron DeSantis in current Republican polls, she rarely referred to either by name during the confab with Iowa voters. Instead, she promoted a litany of Republican issues - cut federal spending, reduce inflation, close the southern border, oppose gun control - while echoing several themes she hopes to use to climb the primary ladder. Haley said she would support whoever Republicans nominate for president, though she expects it to be herself. ""I don't play for second."" she said. Nikki Haley on 2024 White House campaign: 'Why not me?' Who is Nikki Haley? Former S.C. GOP governor announces run for president in 2024 Among Haley's goals: Haley drew distinctions with the former president only when asked, and then sought to portray him as part of the baggage the nation should leave behind. When CNN moderator Jake Tapper brought up the pro-Trump insurrection of Jan. 6, 2021, Haley said: ""He thinks it was a beautiful day; I think it was a terrible day. I'll always stand by that."" Haley appeared to dispute Trump's claim that the 2020 election was stolen - ""we know that President Biden is the president,"" she said - but added the conduct of elections in some states remains a big issue. ""Voters want to have election integrity,"" Haley said. ""That's the biggest thing."" Democrats were unimpressed with any Haley effort to separate herself from Trump. In a statement, the Democratic National Committee said ""her extreme, anti-freedom candidacy is just as MAGA as the rest of the 2024 GOP field.¡± Citing her experience at the United Nations during the Trump administration, Haley came out strongly for support of Ukraine in its war with Russia. That is a contrast to Trump and his call for negotiations between the two combatants that could lead to concessions to Russia. ""That's a mistake that too many have made,"" Haley said. She also bashed for Trump for congratulating dictator Kim Jong Un for North Korea's new position with the World Health Organization. While not repeating Trump's name, Haley said Un is a ""thug"" and that there is ""no reason"" to congratulate him for anything. Rather than a full-force attack on her Republican opponents, Haley preferred to focus on Democratic President Joe Biden. During the town hall in Iowa - which will host the first delegate selection contest of the 2024 Republican race - Haley hit Biden on issues like the botched withdrawal from Afghanistan, addressing Chinese threats to Taiwan, and the growth of federal spending in the wake of COVID. Haley has said she would sign a national abortion ban, but sought to avoid discussing it during the CNN town hall, claiming it is very unlikely Congress would pass such restrictions. Abortion opponents would need to have support from at least 60 U.S. senators in order to avoid a filibuster, and that is a longshot, Haley said. So opponents need to focus on what can be accomplished, such as a late-term abortion and policies that encourage adoption. ""I want to save as many babies as we can,"" Haley said. Some Republicans fear that moderate voters in a general election will back Democrats over their support for abortion rights. Haley stressed her years as South Carolina governor, saying it gave her experience in developing the economy and working with members of both parties. In the town hall, she discussed her decision to take down the Confederate battle flag from the statehouse after the murders of nine people at Black church in Charleston. Haley cast the flag removal as an example of how she can forge unity, explaining how she had to work on fellow conservative Republicans to accomplish the task. ""We had an obligation to make sure that we got it right,"" she said.? Before she can truly challenge Trump, Haley has to first get past DeSantis, who is in second place in most polls. So she hit DeSantis - and Trump - for declining to address entitlement spending like Social Security and Medicare, saying those massive programs have to be reformed before federal spending and the national debt can be brought under control. Haley also criticized the Florida governor for his state's lawsuit with Disney, saying he should resolve his issues with such a large employer. Haley also found time to mention that she would be the first woman, and first woman of color, to be president, though she downplayed that factor - sort of. After saying ""it'll be nice to have that out of the way,"" Haley then noted that all of the nation's presidents have been males. ""We've let guys do it for a while,"" she said. ""It might be time for a woman to get it done.""",USA

Deja Taylor was charged last week with illegally using drugs while owning a firearm and making a false statement about using marijuana when she purchased the gun, court records show. Her son used the weapon to shoot first grade teacher Abby Zwerner in January. Taylor, who is also charged in state court in connection with the shooting, could have faced up to 25 years in prison on the federal charges, but Taylor¡¯s attorneys settled with prosecutors on an agreement that calls for and 18- to 24-month sentence. Sentencing is set for October. ¡°Federal requirements for firearm ownership are not optional and exist to protect owners, their family members, and the communities where they live,"" Jessica D. Aber, U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, said in a statement after the plea hearing. ""Failing to abide by those requirements when purchasing or possessing a firearm can have far-reaching consequences.¡± The shooting sparked national attention and criticism in Newport News, Virginia, as concerns were raised over whether school administrators could have prevented the incident. Administrators are facing a $40 million lawsuit filed by Zwerner, who was critically injured in the shooting. Newport News school shooting:Deja Taylor, mother of 6-year-old who shot teacher in Virginia, to face new federal gun charges Taylor's federal charges appear to be relatively rare at a time when a growing number of states have legalized marijuana, including Virginia. Prosecutors allege Taylor knew she was an ""unlawful user of marijuana"" when she bought a gun last year, but she indicated she wasn't on a form, according to court documents. Taylor also admitted to being a daily marijuana user for about 11 years and that her ""chronic"" use of the drug was not recreational, according to court documents. Although it's legal to grow or have weed in Virginia, it is still considered a controlled substance under federal law, which generally prohibits people from possession of firearms if they are an unlawful user of a controlled substance, among other things. Taylor also was arrested in April and charged in state court with felony child neglect and recklessly leaving a loaded firearm so as to endanger a child, a misdemeanor. She is expected to stand trial in August and faces up to six years in prison if convicted on those charges. Her lawyer Gene Rossi called the case ""a perfect storm of horrible consequences."" ""It's a terrible tragedy because a wonderful teacher's life was almost taken, but it's also a tragedy because a very young boy, a very young son got hold somehow of a gun owned by Ms. Deja Taylor,"" Rossi told USA TODAY. ""Ms. Taylor's role in this tragedy is a complete accident, but she will ¡¦ forever have guilt?for what her son did.""? Federal prosecutors said federal agents searched through Taylor's purse and residences she shared with her grandfather and mother, where they found large amounts of cannabis and drug paraphernalia. On Jan. 19, almost two weeks after Taylor's son shot his teacher, court documents said federal agents discovered narcotics packaging, narcotics paraphernalia, marijuana, marijuana edible packaging, a box of ammunition and a black firearm barrel lock at the home of Taylor's grandfather. Agents also searched the residence of Taylor's mother, where Taylor had been staying at the time, and found more marijuana products. Further investigation into Taylor revealed ""the pervasive scope of Taylor¡¯s marijuana use,"" federal prosecutors wrote. The investigation also uncovered that Taylor was arrested in April 2021 after she was pulled over in a traffic stop for speeding in Williamsburg, Virginia, according to court documents. The Williamsburg Police officer conducting the stop allegedly ""detected an overwhelming odor of marijuana coming from the vehicle"" and ""marijuana was in plain view inside the vehicle,"" federal prosecutors wrote. Taylor's son, who was 4 at the time, was in the vehicle with her and was sitting ""directly next to ¡¦ several marijuana edibles that looked like rice treats,¡± court documents allege. The vehicle, Taylor's purse and a backpack of another person in the car were also searched and allegedly contained more marijuana products, pills, and digital scales. Taylor denied knowledge of all drugs in the vehicle. The top prosecutor handling the case told reporters in March that?Taylor?would not face any charges. Lawyer James Ellenson, who also represents Taylor, previously said it is unclear how the boy got the gun, which was secured with a trigger lock and stored on a high shelf in a closet. But court documents show that federal agents did not find a lockbox, trigger lock or a key to a trigger lock in either of Taylor's residences when they conducted their January search. While authorities did find a firearm barrel lock at the home of Taylor's grandfather, federal prosecutors said the lock had been in a garbage bag that was filled a few weeks before the shooting. ¡°The attorney¡¯s statements that the gun was safely secured defied common sense, now we know it also defied the evidence,"" Diane Toscano, Zwerner's lawyer, said in a statement to USA TODAY. Taylor's son, who has not been identified, shot Zwerner?on Jan. 6 while she was reading to students in her classroom at Richneck Elementary in Newport News. Zwerner?was shot in the hand and the chest, according to police. The school district was repeatedly warned the boy might have a gun the day of the shooting, according to the $40 million lawsuit Zwerner?filed alleging gross negligence. The boy had a history of behavioral challenges and violence towards teachers, the lawsuit said. Taylor has?said her son has ADHD. The boy's family also said he was typically accompanied to class by a parent as part of a care plan with the school, but he was unaccompanied for the first time the week of the shooting because his behavior had improved.

Christie rips Trump, makes case for 2024 in town hall: 7 takeaways.","Republican Chris Christie used a 90-minute town hall on CNN Tuesday to present the most robust conservative case to date against Donald Trump being the GOP nominee for president in 2024. The former New Jersey governor presented a stark warning to the country in front of a live audience that included voters from the first four primary states. ""I am convinced if (Trump) goes back to the White House, that the next four years will be all about him settling scores... with everybody who he thinks wasn¡¯t perfectly nice to him,"" Christie said. Christie, who previously backed Trump, said the critical moment he changed his view was when Trump began peddling false claims about losing the 2020 presidential contest. ""That is a child,"" he said. ""That's a child's reaction, everybody. Every parent out there recognizes it, knows it."" In a growing primary field, Christie has tried to set himself apart by being the fiercest attack dog against the front-runner. But he also was asked about his own views and policy prescriptions on topics ranging from abortion and gun control to how he plans to claw his way to the Republican mountaintop and challenge Democratic President Joe Biden. Here are the key moments. Out of the gate Christie cast Trump as a madman and setup the 2024 Republican primary as the best opportunity to stop the former president from using the country to settle personal and political grudges. ""He's angry and he's vengeful, and he said, 'I will be your retribution'... he wants to be retribution for himself,"" Christie said. A former U.S. attorney, Christie prosecuted the case against Trump mostly through a character lens, describing the reality TV star and real estate mogul as a?""self-centered"" candidate and ""three-time loser"" who hasn't served the Republican Party well since 2016. Asked about the latest indictment against Trump, who faced about three-dozen counts around improperly?taking sensitive and classified information?from the White House and hiding the documents from federal investigators, Christie said it is ""tight, very evidence-laden."" The New Jersey Republican said he doesn't believe Trump was trying to sell the documents or blackmail someone, but rather he kept them in order to ""show off"" to friends and associates. As much as Christie talked about Trump's character, he took a wack at the other GOP rivals. Asked by moderator Anderson Cooper about why the other Republican contenders have mostly defended Trump against the latest prosecution, Christie didn't hold back. ¡°They¡¯re playing political games with you,¡± he said. ""Because they think if I kind of like Trump a little bit, and I don't say anything bad about Trump, and then Trump kind of implodes and goes away, then you're more likely to vote for me."" Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, considered Trump's chief rival in 2024, has broadly slammed the U.S. Department of Justice and criticized ""the weaponization of federal law enforcement,"" but hasn't laid any gloves on Trump. Other opponents, such as former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, initially defended Trump against what she described as an unfair indictment, but she pivoted a bit Tuesday, saying if the allegations are true the former president was ""incredibly reckless"" with national security. No matter, Christie said. ""The only thing he understands is force,"" he said. When voters in attendance grabbed the microphone, many peppered Christie ? who is in the basement of the current polls ? with questions about what specific skills or experience sets him apart from the other candidates. Christie pitched himself as a two-term Republican governor in a blue state who knows how to compromise. That will matter in Washington, where there is often a divided government. But Christie said his record shows he can get things done in a divided government. ""And with all due respect to these governors from red states, who have Republican legislatures, man I'm telling you, I would have given my right arm to have a Republican legislature for a week,"" he said. ""They would have never slept, we would have done so much in that week."" The 60-year-old former New Jersey governor said it's a ""coin flip"" when asked who is worse between Biden with his age or Trump with his indictments. But Christie dove right into bringing up the A-word. ""If those two people were the?nominees, they are going to be a?combined 160 years old on?Election Day,"" he said.?""I'm sorry, guys, nobody beats?father time.?Nobody does."" How old is too old to be president has been a consistent issue through the early stages of this race, particularly for the 80-year-old Biden, whose age is a concern for Democrats. Trump isn't that far behind at 76. Christie said he can't imagine being president two decades from now. ""They are past their sell-by dates,"" he said. One somber moment came when a voter whose son was killed in the 2017 Las Vegas mass shooting, which claimed 58 lives, asked what, if anything, can be done to curb such horrific massacres while protecting gun rights. Christie said it is the most difficult public policy question in America, emphasizing law enforcement must become more aware of mental health issues in their communities, ""because in the end, those people almost always send off signs and signals."" But ultimately Christie admitted as a father he feels that answer is ""wholly inadequate"" given the gravity of the violence. ""And so all I can say to you is that I will do my very best to try to come up with some compromise that can bring all sides together on this that can make it better,"" he said. Christie made clear he opposes abortion and that ""every life is precious and should be protected,"" but he was pressed on whether he backs a national ban as some social conservatives have demanded. The New Jersey Republican said that isn't something to be worried about right now at the federal level, and the debate should be among the 50 states making their own decisions. He noted, for example, how many thought Kansas would be an anti-abortion state, but that voters there protected it as a right. ""We're not at a consensus point,"" he said. One of the dividing lines in the 2024 Republican primary is Russia¡¯s war with Ukraine. Christie defended U.S. support for Ukraine¡¯s military, but described it as ¡°a proxy war with China.¡± On multiple occassions Christie set up how the U.S. is in conflict with China, which will define the 21st Century as the latter is looking to set ""the tone for this world."" Christie also mentioned the rise of TikTok, which some lawmakers have suggested be banned in America. He suggested a social media peace treaty of sorts, pointing out how Facebook and Twitter are not allowed in China. ""They let Facebook, Twitter and our social media into China, I'll let TikTok stay, they don't?TikTok goes,"" he said.",USA

Anderson Aldrich, 23, is facing more than 300 charges, including first-degree murder and hate crimes, in connection with the shooting at Club Q in November. Colorado law requires victims be notified of potential plea deals, and several of those who survived or lost loved ones in the attack told the AP state prosecutors alerted them Aldrich would plead guilty and face the maximum state sentence. A spokesperson for Colorado's Fourth Judicial District Attorney's office declined to comment on the potential plea deal, and a defense attorney for the suspect did not immediately respond to a request for comment from USA TODAY. Aldrich is expected to appear in court for an arraignment June 26, according to court records. Prosecutors asked survivors to write victim impact statements for the hearing and prepare for the possible release of surveillance footage of the shooting. Michael Anderson, who was bartending at Club Q at the time of the shooting, told prosecutors he wanted a fast resolution of the criminal case, according to the AP. ¡°My fear is that if this takes years, that prevents the processing and moving on and finding peace beyond this case,¡± he told the outlet. ¡°I would love this wrapped up as quickly as possible under the guarantee that justice is served.¡± Aldrich, who identifies as nonbinary, faces more than 300 state charges. Defense attorneys argued during a?preliminary hearing earlier this year?that there was no evidence Aldrich committed a hate crime, but Fourth Judicial District Judge Michael McHenry declined to drop any of the charges.? The Justice Department also is considering filing federal hate crime charges, the AP reported, citing a senior law enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity. It¡¯s unclear whether a plea deal for the state charges would also resolve the federal investigation, the outlet reported. The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Previously:Judge refuses to drop hate crime charges against Colorado Springs shooting suspect Aldrich is accused of opening fire with an AR-15 style rifle at the nightclub before bar patrons, including Army veteran Richard Fierro, helped subdue him.

Separate problems, that is: Biden's age and Trump's legal troubles are giving a third of the voters they are likely to target second thoughts about supporting them in a race that is already close, a new USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll finds. While their challenges could hardly be more different ? Biden's date of birth beyond his control, while allegations of Trump's actions have brought indictments in state and now federal court ? the political impact at the moment is strikingly similar. For Biden, 37% of Democratic and Independent voters say the 80-year-old president's age makes them less likely to vote for him; just 3% say it makes them more likely. A 56% majority say it doesn't make a difference. For Trump, 34% of Republican and Independent voters say his legal situation makes them less likely to vote for him, though another slice, 11%, say it makes them more likely to support him. A 51% majority say it doesn't make a difference. The nationwide survey of 1,000 registered voters, taken by landline and cellphone June 5-9, has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points. Most of the interviews were completed before Trump announced he would be indicted on federal charges related to his handling of sensitive government documents after he left the White House. In recent weeks, he also has been indicted on state charges in New York and found civilly liable for sexual abuse and defamation. The liabilities voters see in the all-but-certain Democratic nominee and the leading contender for the Republican nomination have left the contest unsettled and fueled interest in third parties, although no significant independent contender has yet emerged. ""We have a choice between some kind of a maniac who tried to take over the government and a guy who's old and can hardly see,"" complained Carl Listrom, 82, a retired bookkeeper from Platte County, Missouri, who was among those polled. A Democrat, he voted for Biden in 2020 and would support him again, but not with alacrity. ""I'm less enthusiastic ? his age, his white hair,"" he said. But then he referred to Trump's role in the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol. ""That coup d'etat that he put together, that was the last straw for me."" Both contenders have entered unprecedented territory. Biden is already the oldest person to serve as president, and Trump is the first ex-president to be indicted. If there is a 2020 rematch between them, Biden now narrowly edges Trump, 34% to 32%, with 23% supporting an unnamed third-party candidate and another 10% undecided. Biden's advantage is within the poll's margin of error. If Biden faces Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, the president leads by more, 33%-26%, with 25% supporting a third-party candidate and 14% undecided. ""If they have a good chance of winning, then, yes, I would absolutely support a third party,"" said Sarah Foust, 37, a preschool teacher from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. A Republican who voted for Trump in 2020, she is ""75%"" inclined to vote for him again. ""I'm a conservative; I would say right-leaning but mostly God-fearing,"" she said. She said Trump ""got the job done"" as president but also triggered such negative reactions from opponents that she is concerned about electing him again. ""I don't want to see anybody getting hurt,"" she said. For Biden, even some of his strong supporters express concern about his age. ""He is getting older; I worry about that a little bit,"" said Thomas Egge, 36, a Democrat from Decatur, Georgia. ""I mean, obviously, it'd be exciting if we had somebody young who was coming in and had a lot of positions we could vote for."" In the last election, he was a fan of Pete Buttigieg, now the Transportation secretary. He's 41. Even as Trump prepares to be arraigned in federal court in Miami Tuesday afternoon, he has opened a yawning lead in the race for the Republican nomination. In the survey, he was the first choice of 48% of those who plan to vote in GOP primaries and caucuses, a lead of 25 percentage points over DeSantis, at 23%. No other candidate breaks into double-digits. South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott is at 6%. Former Vice President Mike Pence and former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley are at 4%. Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is at 2%. Former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson and former conservative talk-show host Larry Elder are at 1%. North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum received no support. When the first and second choices of Republican primary voters are combined, a test of how broadly acceptable they are in the party, Trump is backed by 63% and DeSantis by 51%. Scott was named by 16% and Pence by 11%. ""I think someone new is good, someone new and younger, and less, hopefully, less corrupt,"" said Jennifer Anthony, 25, a project engineer from Austin, Texas, and an independent. She voted for Biden in 2020 but Democratic challenger Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is now her top choice. In the survey, Biden was supported by 58% of those who plan to vote in Democratic primaries and caucuses. Kennedy was at 15% and self-help author Marianne Williamson at 6%. If Biden holds the Democratic nomination, Anthony said her preferred candidate among Republicans would be DeSantis. ""I think he's willing to stand up for some things,"" she said. Asked about the most important issue determining their vote, 22% overall cite inflation ? the top issue but one with a partisan divide. It was named by twice as many Republicans as Democrats, 33% compared with 15%. The second-ranking issue for Republicans is immigration, chosen by 21%. Among Democrats, gun control ties with inflation as the most important issue. ""Threats to democracy"" is third, cited by 12%. ""The poll gives us a roadmap of what primary candidates should focus on and when,"" said David Paleologos, director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center. ""In the GOP primary, the key issues ? combining first and second choices ? are inflation (45%) and immigration (40%). That's it. In the Democratic primaries, candidates need to address a broader spectrum of issues including gun control, health care, inflation, education, and threats to democracy, which all polled in the twenties."" Karen Green, 63, an independent from Athens, Texas, puts the economy at the top of her list but notes that other issues matter to her, too. She voted for Biden last time; now she's interested in hearing more from Kennedy and Christie. ""I can tell you, it won't be Trump,"" she said. ""I would like to feel like my president is honest and can keep his story straight.""",USA

So what are extremist groups targeting now?,"Former president Donald Trump's appearance in Miami courtroom this week didn't spark the sort of violence and chaos from extremist supporters that had been feared. Instead, the far-right remains fixated on anti-LGBTQ hate, as evidenced by a rash of hate crimes against pride flags across the country. An Army private pleads guilty to terrorist charges for attempting to assist ISIS in attacking US troops. But first: In a development in a case that has been a touchstone for extremist issues, the suspect in the deadly Colorado Springs LGBTQ nightclub attack speaks. It's the week in extremism. New this week: Anderson Aldrich, accused of killing five people and injuring 17 in a mass shooting at a?Colorado Springs?LGBTQ nightclub?last year, is expected to accept a plea deal that would guarantee a life sentence. The Club Q shooting, which targeted a known club for the gay community during a drag show, appeared to many extremism researchers to be the fulfillment of an age-old pattern: Rhetoric marginalizes a community until someone gets attacked. More:Survivors of Colorado Springs mass shooting at Club Q say suspect likely to take plea deal More:Will Trump draw violent protesters to Miami? Experts monitor chance ahead of arraignment The news this week was dominated by the unprecedented federal criminal indictment of Trump. Amid much speculation about whether extremists would show up in numbers at his court hearing in Miami on Tuesday, in the end the day was fairly quiet, with perhaps a couple hundred protesters who were largely outnumbered my the media present. Experts had previously told USA TODAY they didn't expect much in the way of protests and violence, for a number of factors laid out in this story. The primary threat from extremists remains an attack by a lone actor or small cell angry at the prosecution of the former President ? a risk that is likely to remain as Trump's legal woes escalate. More:Gay Pride flag attacks mount amid online challenges by extremist groups While it was largely ignoring Trump's legal woes and calls for protests, the extremist far-right continued its campaign against the LGBTQ community. As USA TODAY reported late last week, a rash of attacks against pride flags has been reported across the country. In the latest in a rash of extremism-related prosecutions of members of the military, Cole Bridges, a 22-year-old U.S. Army private pleaded guilty on Wednesday to charges of attempting to provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization and attempting to murder U.S. military service members. That's how many different hate symbols are included in a first-of-its-kind online database of global hate symbols launched this week by the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism. The directory includes symbols representing far-right and bigoted ideologies, including but not limited to neo-Nazi, white nationalist, anti-LGBTQ+, anti-immigrant, male supremacist, anti-Muslim, antisemitic, and others. Symbols are tagged by all ideologies that apply. ¡°This tool will help to identify where far-right actors are active, the narratives they are pushing, and will help show ? from chatrooms to violent extremism ? how hate and extremist groups and individuals inspire and connect each other across borders,¡± said Global Project Against Hate and Extremism co-founder Wendy Via.",USA

Gun violence survivors, activists and elected officials gathered in Connecticut on Friday to mark nearly one year since Congress passed the most significant gun safety package in three decades. President Joe Biden gave the keynote address at the summit at the University of Hartford. The gathering was organized by proponents of the deal, including gun safety advocacy groups Giffords and Everytown for Gun Safety and U.S. Sens. Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut. Biden signed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act last summer in the wake of mass killings in Buffalo, New York; Uvalde, Texas; and Tulsa, Oklahoma; and days before the mass shooting at a Fourth of July parade in Illinois. ""One year ago we did come together. We did hear the call from too many families ... 'Do something, do something,'"" Biden said in his speech. ""The response usually was, 'My prayers are with you.' Prayers are fine ¡¦ but it is not going to stop it. You have to take action, you have to move, you have to do something. ""We did pass the most meaningful gun safety law in 30 years,"" Biden said. Summit attendees evaluated the direct impact of the legislation thus far and identified the next steps. Biden called for Congress and states to pass even more gun safety legislation: ""We are not finished."" The event comes as available data suggests the U.S. is seeing a year-over-year decline in murders nationwide. At the same time, mass shootings appear to be accelerating. The landmark deal ? the culmination of decades of gun safety advocacy work ? focuses on keeping firearms out of the hands of dangerous people and investing in school safety and mental health resources. It created a $750 million funding pot to incentivize states to create ""red flag laws,"" closed the ""boyfriend loophole"" by adding convicted domestic violence abusers in dating relationships to the national criminal background check system, clarified the definition of a ""federally licensed firearm dealer,"" made it a federal crime to traffic in firearms, stiffened penalties for ""straw purchases"" made on behalf of people who aren¡¯t allowed to own guns and enhanced background checks for buyers under 21. The law also appropriated billions in funding for schools and mental health services. That includes $150 million for a national 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline, $250 million for states and territories to enhance community mental health services, $500 million to increase the number of school-based mental health providers and $500 million to train school counselors, social workers and psychologists. It also set aside $250 million for community-based violence prevention initiatives. But proponents of gun safety didn't get everything they wanted in the package, such as a federal red flag law and reinstating the nation¡¯s ban on ""assault weapons."" Which states prohibit 'assault weapons'?With ban on AR-15s, Washington joins these states The legislation has resulted in dozens of federal charges and blocked the purchase of more than 100 firearm purchases, early information suggests. At least 31 people have been charged in 17 cases under new federal straw purchasing and trafficking criminal offenses, data from federal prosecutors through April shows. Investigations:DOJ's gun control effort showing progress on straw purchases, gun trafficking The laws are ""powerful new tools"" that are designed to enhance ATF¡¯s ability to identify, deter, and investigate those who illegally divert firearms from lawful commerce, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives spokeswoman Carolyn Collins said in an email to USA TODAY at the time. Denials stemming from enhanced background checks for people under 21 blocked more than 130 firearm purchases between November and April, Peter Carr, a spokesman for the Department of Justice, previously told USA TODAY. And, in September, the Justice Department awarded an initial $100 million to community violence prevention and intervention programs that focus on addressing gun violence. The first batch of 47 grants went to community-based nonprofits and city-led collaboratives across the country. See a map here. What's community violence intervention?DOJ pitches plan after awarding $100M in grants. The U.S. doesn't have reliable federal data on crime, so the task of tracking national crime trends has long fallen to a handful of independent researchers and coalitions. According to research by Jeff Asher, co-founder of AH Datalytics, murder has declined about 12% so far this year from the year before, but the murder rate remains the highest since the 1990s. Asher, who has been tracking murder trends since 2015, based his analysis on police department data from nearly 100 U.S. cities. Another analysis suggests the U.S. is seeing a decline in homicides and gun assaults as robberies and property crimes rise and motor vehicle thefts and carjackings increase. The report from the Council on Criminal Justice, a think tank?with hundreds of members, tracked data from dozens of U.S. cities in 2022. ""It¡¯s already saving lives. There are fewer deaths occurring,"" Biden said of the law on Friday. Families of mass shooting victims spoke at the summit Friday, with scheduled appearances from Nelba M?rquez-Greene, whose 6-year-old daughter, Ana Grace, was killed in the Sandy Hook shooting, and Nicole Hockley, whose 6-year-old son, Dylan, was killed in the same massacre. The group was expected to hold a moment of silence for victims of gun violence. Aalayah Eastmond, who survived the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, in 2018, and other survivors described what they went through in that attack when a gunman killed 17 people. ""No 16-year-old should have to hide beneath the body of their classmate to survive, but I did,"" Eastmond said. ""School should not be a war zone.""

Hunter Biden agreed to plead guilty to two misdemeanor counts of tax evasion in federal court in Delaware and participate in a pretrial program for a firearm offense, after a multi-year investigation into his tax matters, a case with implications for President Joe Biden's reelection campaign and dealings with congressional Republicans. U.S. Attorney David Weiss filed a letter in federal court Tuesday citing the charges and the plea agreement. In one case, the president's son will plead guilty to the tax charges, which allege willful failure to pay federal income tax. In another case, he agreed to enter a pretrial diversion agreement for the gun offense, in which he acknowledged unlawful possession of a Colt Cobra 38SPL revolver, despite being addicted to drugs. The Justice Department will recommend probation for tax charges, according to The Associated Press, based on an unnamed source. The diversion program could eventually lead to dismissal of the gun charge. Weiss asked the court ? a judge has not yet been assigned ? to set a date to formally process the plea agreements. Weiss began in 2018 with questions about taxes on overseas business deals, after his work in Ukraine and China drew federal scrutiny. Biden's lawyer, Christopher Clark, said his understanding is that the agreements resolve the five-year investigation. ""Hunter will take responsibility for two instances of misdemeanor failure to file tax payments when due pursuant to a plea agreement,"" Clark said. ""I know Hunter believes it is important?to take responsibility for these mistakes he made during a period of turmoil and addiction in his life.?He looks forward to continuing his recovery and moving forward."" Biden himself disclosed the inquiry in December 2020. Asked Tuesday if he had spoken with his son, President Biden said, ""I¡¯m very proud of my son."" The White House has previously said the president hasn't discussed the investigation with Attorney General Merrick Garland or the Justice Department. ¡°The President and First Lady love their son and support him as he continues to rebuild his life,"" Ian Sams, a White House spokesperson, said in a statement. ""We will have no further comment.¡± The case has political implications. Former President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans have attacked Hunter Biden as a potentially bad influence on his father. Trump appointed Weiss. IRS agents say they were removed from the probe. Hunter Biden has sued a laptop repairman for allegedly distributing private personal information to Trump supporters and reporters. Here is what we know about the inquiry: One of the court filings explained the basis for the tax charges against Hunter Biden. He allegedly received more than $1.5 million in taxable income during 2017, when he lived in Washington, D.C., and owed the federal government more than $100,000, according to a court record. He was required to pay the tax by April 2018 but didn't, according to the document filed by Leo Wise and Derek Hines, two special assistant U.S. attorneys in Weiss's office. Biden again received more than $1.5 million in 2018 and failed to pay his taxes by April 2019, according to the document. Congressional Republicans have questioned Biden's overseas business deals. A whistleblower at the Internal Revenue Service, which has been investigating Biden for potential tax violations, told lawmakers in May his entire team was removed from the probe, according to a letter from his lawyers obtained by USA TODAY. Mark Lytle, the attorney for the IRS whistleblower, wrote to lawmakers that his client has information about a ¡°failure to mitigate clear conflicts of interest in the ultimate disposition¡± of?a criminal investigation related to Biden¡¯s taxes?and whether he made a false statement in connection with a gun purchase. The letter said the IRS criminal supervisory special agent ""was informed that he and his entire investigative team are being removed from the ongoing and sensitive investigation of the high-profile, controversial subject about which our client sought to make whistleblower disclosures to Congress."" The Justice Department informed the whistleblower about the change. Another charge in Weiss's inquiry alleges Biden made a false statement on a federal form when he bought a gun in 2018. The Gun Control Act prohibits drug users from possessing firearms. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives ruled the ban applies to ""a conviction for use or possession of a controlled substance within the past year."" Biden filled out a federal form when he bought a handgun in October 2018 in which he replied ¡°no¡± to a question of whether he was ¡°an unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any depressant, stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance,"" according to the Washington Post. By his own account in his memoir ¡°Beautiful Things,¡± Biden battled drug addiction and for periods during 2018 smoked crack ¡°every 15 minutes.¡± But Biden could potentiallly challenge the law under his Second Amendment right to bear arms. The Supreme Court overturned a New York gun law in June 2022, in a decision that threatened a variety of firearms regulations. A?laptop became a focal point?of congressional inquiries because it contained a trove of documents and pictures of Hunter Biden. When Trump raised questions about the laptop at a 2020 presidential debate, Joe Biden initially replied that it was Russian disinformation. The laptop¡¯s legitimacy has?since been confirmed by CBS News and The Washington Post, but the contents remain under investigation. Biden drug addition:Hunter Biden's drug use back in public eye as criminal charges could be around the corner A?computer repairman, John Paul Mac Isaac,?gave the laptop information to the FBI?after Hunter Biden failed to pick up the MacBook Pro following repairs in April 2019. Mac Isaac later gave a copy of the laptop's contents to Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, who shared the material Trump's political supporters and with reporters. Hunter Biden filed a claim in federal court alleging?Mac Isaac violated his privacy, took part in a conspiracy and helped?others invade his privacy. The filing was in response to a $1.5 million lawsuit for alleged defamation that the?repairman filed in Delaware Superior Court against Biden, CNN, Politico and Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. The case has been moved to U.S. District Court in Delaware. The inquiry carried political implications from the start because of his father's ambition as a former vice president to return to the White House and because of clashes with congressional Republicans. House Republicans led by Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., have argued that Hunter Biden peddled influence on the administration through lucrative business deals and the sale of art. For example, the House Oversight and Accountability Committee released a report in March saying Hunter Biden and other relatives received $1.3 million from a business associate after he received a wire transfer from a Chinese company. Biden paternity case:How the Biden family name became latest wrinkle in Hunter Biden's paternity battle Comer called the charges a ""slap on the wrist"" and said they reflect a ""two-tiered system of justice.""

The suspect accused of killing five people and injuring 17 others at an LGBTQ nightclub in Colorado Springs pleaded guilty Monday to multiple murder charges and other crimes. Anderson Lee Aldrich, 23, pleaded guilty to five counts of first-degree murder and 46 counts of attempted first-degree murder and no contest two counts of bias-motivated crimes, one a felony and the other a misdemeanor. Aldrich was initially charged with more than 300 crimes in connection to the mass shooting at Club Q in November. According to the plea deal, Aldrich will serve five consecutive life sentences without the possibility of parole on the murder charges and 46 consecutive 48-year sentences on the attempted murder charges, Judge Michael McHenry said Monday. The plea deal spares survivors and victims' family members, many of whom spoke at Monday's hearing, a potentially painful trial. Aldrich opened fire with?an AR-15-style rifle?at the nightclub before bar patrons, including Army veteran Richard Fierro, helped subdue them. ¡°I intentionally and after deliberation caused the death of each victim,¡± Aldrich told?McHenry Monday. Crying could be heard in the courtroom as McHenry read the names of of Aldrich's victims, including the five killed ? Ashley Paugh, Raymond Green Vance, Kelly Loving, Daniel Davis Aston and Derrick Rump. As the arraignment shifted into a sentencing hearing, survivors and family members of those killed in the attack spoke about their loved ones. ""I was celebrating my birthday when this heinous attack happened, and not only have I lost my partner, my sense of safety, but I've also lost a massive sense of safety for our community as a whole,"" said Wyatt Kent, a drag performer who was in a relationship with Aston, a Club Q bartender. ""We as queer people were attacked on November 19."" District Attorney Michael Allen described the deal as one that ""achieves the highest measure of justice possible under the law in the state of Colorado while allowing the victims and their families to continue forward on their path toward healing.¡± Aldrich declined to speak during sentencing, but their attorney Joseph Archambault said in a statement Aldrich is ¡°deeply remorseful."" McHenry condemned Aldrich¡¯s actions, saying they ""reflect the deepest malice of the human heart, and is almost always born of ignorance and fear.¡± ¡°The sentence of this court is the judgment of the people of the state of Colorado that such hate will not be tolerated and that the LGBTQ+ community is as much a part of the family of humanity as you are,¡± McHenry said. Several of the victims cried and held each other as Aldrich was sentenced, while Aldrich showed no visible emotion. The district attorney¡¯s office has 45 days to determine restitution. Many, including Aston¡¯s mother, Sabrina Aston, said they would not forgive the shooter. Fierro, one of the patrons who helped subdue Aldrich, described the shooting as a ""terrorist attack"" and called Aldrich's actions ""unforgivable."" ¡°I want him to know his evil was stopped by a person of color, by LGBTQ folks, by a transgender woman, by actual combat veterans, real heroes,"" Fierro said. Michael Anderson said Aldrich destroyed a safe haven for the LGBTQ community in Colorado Springs. Anderson said he was expecting a simple night working the bar at Club Q and was in the middle of pouring drink for a regular customer when Aldrich decided to ""began hunting us down."" ¡°I¡¯m grateful to have survived that night, but my expectation was that me, Derrick and Daniel would all clock out that night and go home,"" Anderson said. ""I'm the only one who got to clock out that night and that's not fair."" Matthew Haynes, owner of Club Q, pledged the nightclub would reopen. ¡°You did not succeed in destroying this community, Club Q will open with a memorial to those killed to remember those that were killed for generations to come,"" Haynes said. ""Your hate and the hate of others will not win."" In addition to the hundreds of state charges, Aldrich could face federal hate crime charges, according to The Associated Press. The Justice Department is considering filing federal hate crime charges, the outlet reported, citing a senior law enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity. It¡¯s unclear whether a plea deal for the state charges would also resolve the federal investigation, the Associated Press reported. The Justice Department declined to comment. Aldrich told the outlet they plan to take responsibility for the attack at Monday's hearing, but some survivors who listened to Aldrich's recorded jailhouse phone calls with The Associated Press saw their comments as an attempt to avoid the federal death penalty.

But skeptics say his platform crosses the political spectrum, ranging from those of a ¡°Kennedy Democrat¡± to issues that resonate more with the right.? Former President Donald Trump, the Republican front-runner, recently called Kennedy a ""very smart guy and a good guy"" on a radio show. Trump allies are supporting him, including former Fox News host Tucker Carlson who dedicated an episode of his Twitter show to Kennedy. Steve Bannon,?a former senior aide in Trump's White House, promoted Kennedy on his War Room?podcast in April. The candidate also has found favor and airtime with other celebrities. Joe Rogan, a talk show host who has been critical of the government's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccines, hosted Kennedy on his show to discuss vaccines. Rogan backed Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., in the 2020 presidential race and has supported Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican candidate, so far this year. Kennedy has had to defend many of his own claims, specifically around his views that vaccines are linked to autism. Vaccines do not cause autism, according to the CDC and the National Institutes of Health. ? These views have led critics to question his stances ? such as comments Kennedy made in a video recently circulating on social media where he falsely claims AIDS is caused not by HIV but by a ""gay lifestyle"" and addiction to drugs historically used in the LGBTQ community. But his candidacy resonates with some. A CNN poll May 25 found Kennedy polling at 20% in the Democratic field against President Joe Biden and self-help author Marianne Williamson. Who is running for president in 2024?Take a closer look at every candidate so far He is the fourth member of the family running for president with the Kennedy name. ?? The son of former U.S. Attorney General?Robert F. Kennedy, who also served as a New York senator, and nephew of former President John F. Kennedy, both Democrats assassinated in the 1960s, the junior Kennedy told USA TODAY having the family name behind him will help him in the race. ? But not all his family supports him. Several family members in 2019 wrote a POLITICO op-ed condemning Kennedy for spreading misinformation about vaccines. They wrote that Kennedy ""spread dangerous misinformation"" and "" is complicit in sowing distrust of the science behind vaccines."" Others have publicly said that they will not vote for him in 2024. ?? But Kennedy said that despite the disagreements, he has a great relationship with his family. ? ¡°We were raised to argue and dispute each other at the dinner table every night. My grandfather did this with his children. My father and mother did it with us to get us to take positions and to argue our case,¡± he told USA TODAY in an interview in May. ? A Harvard graduate, Kennedy?worked at several environmental nonprofits, serving as an environmental lawyer at the Natural Resources Defense Council and as president of the Waterkeeper Alliance for more than 20 years. His advocacy focused on clean water, the environment, energy and human rights. ?? He later started his own nonprofit, the Children¡¯s Health Defense, which?he formed with vaccine safety advocates. The organization focuses on anti-vaccine messaging, claiming its mission is to ¡°end childhood health epidemics by working aggressively to eliminate harmful exposures.¡± ?? During COVID-19, Kennedy criticized the government's handling of the pandemic and vaccines ? even?losing his Instagram account when he was accused of spreading misinformation about the virus. He criticized the lockdowns, suggesting things were worse for Americans than they were for Anne Frank, the Jewish teenager who hid with her family during the Holocaust and died in a concentration camp.??? Kennedy later?apologized for the comments. It marked the second time he apologized for comparing Nazis and the Holocaust to public health measures. In 2015,?he used the word ""Holocaust"" to describe children he believes were hurt by vaccines.?? Kennedy defends his views on vaccines and his criticism for how the government handled the pandemic to those who say his views aren¡¯t based on facts. ?? ¡°It¡¯s irrelevant,¡± he said in May. ¡°There¡¯s no Democratic version of the truth or Republican version of the truth. We should have evidence-based policy, and I think everybody ultimately would like to support that.¡± He added in Norristown, ¡°If you can show me a study that is a well-founded study that challenges my position, I'll just change my position."" For some voters, the evidence is?not convincing. ? After seeing Kennedy in Norristown, Julie Centafont felt that some of his positions ""are a little bit out there for me.""? ""He needs to hone his message,"" said Centafont, who identifies as center-left on the political spectrum. ""If he's going to make claims, he has to be clear in what the claims are and then support them."" ? Kennedy struggles to label himself when asked where he falls on the political spectrum. ? ¡°I think the party definitions are so topsy-turvy right now, I wouldn¡¯t know how to describe myself,¡± he told USA TODAY. ¡°I would describe myself as a liberal Democrat, which means I¡¯m for civil liberties, I¡¯m against war, I¡¯m against corporate domination, I¡¯m against censorship.? ¡°But I don¡¯t know now ? those are kind of Republican issues now, strangely.¡± On issues like gun control, Kennedy says he leans right and said in Norristown that he has no plans to take away anyone¡¯s guns. On abortion, he feels the?government should not be telling people what to do with their bodies and it should be up to the woman during the first three months of pregnancy.?? ¡°I feel like there is a hunger for a different direction,"" he told USA TODAY. ""People do not like the direction our country is going, and they don¡¯t particularly think that President Trump or President Biden are going to do a course correction.""? Kennedy told USA TODAY?his motivation for the campaign stems from feeling the country is headed down the wrong path.? ¡°My political party, the Democratic Party, seemed to just have derailed and was just a slow-motion train wreck,¡± he said. ? He says the Democratic Party is departing from the values he witnessed growing up. Now, Kennedy says, Democrats are the party of censorship, war, Wall Street and ""neocons"" ? a word he uses to describe those who ¡°believe the collapse of Soviet Union meant that the United States had to earn the ability to rule the world.¡±?? The middle class has been abandoned by the Democratic Party, he said, and are now migrating to ¡°demagogues like Donald Trump.¡±?? He says his strategy to reboot the country is simple: Tell the truth. ? ¡°I think that¡¯s where it all begins,¡± he said. The messaging resonates with Bren Logan, a registered independent who lives in the greater Philadelphia area. She plans on never voting for a Democratic candidate again, unless Kennedy is the nominee. ? ""He's the only Democrat I will vote for probably for the rest of my life,"" she said, ""unless he restores the Democratic Party to what it once was trying to be."" ? Logan said she?felt ¡°pure elation¡± when he launched his campaign.? ""I don't think people are really being given a fair chance to hear who he truly is, what platforms he's truly running on ? to tell the truth and heal the divide and reinstitute common sense.""

Kennedy Jr. launches unlikely presidential bid backed by 14% of Biden voters Kennedy has also garnered other big-name endorsers: Comedian Rob Schneider, NFL quarterback Aaron Rodgers, actress Alicia Silverstone, former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and the far-right InfoWars host Alex Jones. ? The presidential candidate said?part of his campaign strategy is to reach all supporters ? even those registered to the opposite party. ?? ¡°I¡¯ll talk to anybody who will talk to me,¡± he said. ¡°The only people I¡¯m not talking to are?Steve Bannon and Alex Jones, and personally if it were up to me, I would talk to them, but my wife would probably leave me if I did that.¡±?? Kennedy recently participated with Elon Musk in a Twitter Space, the same platform where DeSantis announced his presidential campaign. Kennedy praised alternative media platforms like Twitter Spaces for giving him a ¡°vector for reaching Americans without going through the corporate media.¡± ? ""That's my only path to victory,"" he told USA TODAY. The candidate spoke for more than two hours with guests including Musk and Tulsi Gabbard, a former Democratic House representative who left the party and registered as an Independent. ?? ¡°Twitter was always kind of the last refuge for those of us who were trying to talk about issues that departed from the official orthodoxies and were being censored on the other platforms,¡± he said during the Twitter Space, calling Musk¡¯s arrival at the social media company a ¡°breath of fresh air for our country.¡±? He told USA TODAY that alternative media such as social media and podcasts provide him with the format to give detailed responses or two-hour speeches that aren¡¯t 30-second TV sound bites. ?? ¡°I think that podcasting is a good media for me because my weakest thing is these short media, five minutes on air, because it takes about five to 10 minutes for my voice to warm up,¡± he said. Kennedy has spasmodic dysphonia, a neurological disorder that affects his speech. ? Sean Rad, who is the co-founder and former CEO of the dating app Tinder, is helping run Kennedy¡¯s digital campaign using platforms like TikTok. Kennedy¡¯s Instagram was reinstated in June.? Kennedy claims his campaign is ¡°largely misunderstood¡± in the media, with most coverage including misstatements about his beliefs or taking his words out of context. ?? ¡°Listen to what I say rather than what people say that I said,¡± he advises voters. ¡°Make up your mind based on what I said rather than a mischaracterization or somebody else¡¯s characterization of what I said.""?? James Taulbee, a retired veteran and small-business owner from York County, Pennsylvania, does just that. ? ""I love that Bobby brings the receipts,"" he said. The 43-year-old sported a ""Kennedy for president"" T-shirt when seeing Kennedy in Norristown. ? Jamal Heacock, an information technology manager who also heard Kennedy speak in Norristown, described the candidate as ""an absolutely fascinating blend of passionate intelligence and crazy."" ? Having the Kennedy name has always been a leg up in the political sphere, but a mixed response from voters coupled with running against an incumbent president make the odds of winning the Democratic primary seem long. ? ¡°My only strategy is to tell the truth to the people,¡± Kennedy said. ¡°If there¡¯s an appetite for that, then I¡¯ll be president in 2025.¡± ?",USA

Acting Police Commissioner Richard Worley said a 20-year-old man and an 18-year-old woman were killed and at least two survivors were in critical condition. Seven others also remained hospitalized late Sunday. The victims ranged in age from 13 to 32; four of them were under 18, Worley said. Officers were studying video and interviewing witnesses to try to identify suspects. Worley said the block party organizers had not obtained a city permit so details of the party were not immediately known.

Jovani Patterson, chairman of the Baltimore advocacy group PEACE, called for tougher penalties and community involvement in the civic discussion on curbing violence on city streets. ""The only thing I can say is it¡¯s sad, and 'sad' doesn¡¯t even begin to explain the magnitude of what I really mean by that,"" he told Channel 45 News. ""This is on everybody.

Two young women approached her saying they had been shot. ¡°I kind of didn¡¯t believe them at first because they were walking up the street.

Zackey Rahimi's legal troubles began in 2019 when he pulled out a gun and fired at a passerby who witnessed him dragging his girlfriend through a parking lot. Months later, after getting into an accident, Rahimi repeatedly shot at the other driver, court records show. A year later, he threatened another woman with a gun and was charged with aggravated assault. In 2021, he fired several times into the air after a friend's credit card was declined at a burger joint near Fort Worth, Texas. Rahimi's case is now before the Supreme Court in a blockbuster Second Amendment challenge that may prove especially thorny for the gun lobby and the court's conservative wing. That's because Rahimi is challenging his conviction under a federal law that bars Americans who are subject to restraining orders from owning guns. ¡°The facts of this case make it really unpalatable for them to have to stand up and say, 'No, we believe that domestic abusers have a Second Amendment right to their firearms,'"" said Nick Suplina, senior vice president for law and policy at Everytown for Gun Safety. ¡°Politically speaking, that's deeply unpopular.¡± Some gun rights groups pushed back on that characterization, arguing that even if Rahimi himself is an unsympathetic figure, the federal law is still inconsistent in their view with the Second Amendment. Rahimi, they say, could have gone to jail for any number of other crimes. As part of his challenge, Rahimi is relying on a standard the Supreme Court set last year that makes it easier for Americans to keep their guns. In a 6-3 opinion invalidating a New York gun licensing law, the court's conservative majority ruled that gun regulations must be ""consistent with this nation¡¯s historical tradition of firearm regulation"" to survive court challenges. That has set off a flurry of research by gun control advocates to find regulations from the nation's founding era that a court may view as analogous to a modern-day gun prohibition. Rahimi, in essence, argues that because there was no regulation that banned guns from people subject to restraining orders at the time of the nation's founding, the federal law that prohibits that ownership today must fall. A federal appeals court in New Orleans sided with Rahimi in March, acknowledging he was ""hardly a model citizen"" but ruling that the law prohibiting him from owning a gun is an ""outlier that our ancestors would never have accepted."" The Biden administration appealed to the Supreme Court, which agreed late last month to hear the case. Arguments will likely take place in the fall. ¡°In some ways Rahimi ¡¦ is the best case for gun safety advocates,"" said Adam Winkler, a law professor at UCLA and a Second Amendment expert. ""The justices are going to be understandably reluctant to say that domestic abusers have a right under the Second Amendment to possess firearms."" Federal law also generally prohibits people from possessing firearms if they have been convicted of a felony, are in the country illegally or have been dishonorably discharged from the military. In 2021, the Supreme Court let stand a series of lower court rulings that prohibited people convicted of driving under the influence, making false statements on tax returns and selling counterfeit cassette tapes from owning a gun. That may also explain why the National Rifle Association, which sought the new standard, has been mostly silent about the case so far. Neither the NRA nor the Firearms Policy Coalition filed amicus briefs when the case was on appeal. And neither responded to multiple requests for comment.? Rahimi is represented by a federal public defender in Texas. That office declined to comment. ? Alan Gottlieb, founder of the Second Amendment Foundation, said that his group intends to weigh into the case with a brief at the Supreme Court. ¡°While we are not sympathetic to the plaintiff in this case the law being challenged has constitutional problems,¡± Gottlieb said. ¡°Sometimes it takes bad plaintiffs (to) make good case law.¡± Erich Pratt, senior vice president of Gun Owners of America, said that his group is ""thrilled"" the Supreme Court agreed to decide the case. Pratt said his group would also file a brief ""in support of overturning the law in question."" ""If someone is dangerous enough that society can¡¯t trust them with a gun, they should be behind bars ? it's that simple,"" Pratt said. ""But this law disarms nonviolent people who have never been convicted of a crime.""",USA

After Dobbs, abortion access will be on the ballot in 2023 and 2024","More than one year after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the battle over abortion access is continuing in courthouses and on ballots in states across the country. The Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women¡¯s Health Organization overturned 50 years of precedent and eliminated constitutional protections for abortion, giving states the power to legislate abortion policies and restrictions. Since the Court's decision last year, 14 states have banned most abortions while other states have had abortion bans blocked in courts. Over the same period, 20 other states have passed legislation to further protect access to abortions. The Court's ruling, however, also made abortion a central issue for many Democratic and Independent voters. Some experts credit the Supreme Court's decision with helping Democrats perform better than expected in the 2022 midterm elections. As the country gears up for its first presidential election since the court ended nationwide protections for abortion, here is a look at how it's set to impact the 2024 election: Groups that support abortion access ? and organizations seeking to restrict it ? are ramping up efforts to get abortion on the ballot this year in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Washington state. In Ohio, abortion-rights advocacy groups are hoping to put a measure on the ballot in November that could allow voters to establish a right to abortion in the state constitution. Earlier this month, the groups said they collected enough signatures to put the measure on the state's ballot, but the initiative is facing pushback from those who are hoping to see it fail, according to Kellie Copeland, who serves as treasurer for Ohioans for Reproductive Freedom. ""We have collected hundreds of thousands of signatures to get a measure on the November 2023 ballot that would amend the Ohio Constitution to explicitly protect reproductive freedom for all,"" Copeland said. Opponents of abortion in Ohio are seeking to use a special election on Aug. 8 to make it more difficult to amend the state Constitution. Only a simple majority is needed to pass ballot measures in Ohio, but some groups who are opposing the amendment want to raise the threshold of votes to 60%. Copeland also pointed to the 2022 midterm elections, when measures on abortion were on the ballot in California, Michigan, Vermont, Kentucky and Montana. In all five states, voters supported maintaining access to abortion. ""We know we can win and protect reproductive freedom in Ohio because when reproductive freedoms are on the ballot, reproductive freedoms win,"" Copeland added. ""This is not a partisan issue, it¡¯s a fundamental right."" In Pennsylvania, however, there is a movement to get a measure on ballots to amend the state's constitution to say that it does not grant a right to abortion. A potential ballot measure in Washington would ask voters to require a parent or guardian to be notified if a minor seeks gender-related care or reproductive health treatment. Abortion-related measures will also be on the ballot when voters go to the polls in November 2024. Voters in New York and Maryland will vote on amendments to their state constitutions that could further strengthen access to abortion. The Equal Rights Amendment in New York would prevent the state from denying rights to people who choose to have an abortion. In Maryland, a constitutional amendment on the ballot would establish a right to abortion. Maryland Gov. Wes Moore said in a statement earlier this year that voters could decide in 2024 whether to enshrine the right to abortion in the state's constitution. ""I¡¯ve been very clear from the beginning that as long as I am the Governor of Maryland, our state will be a safe haven for abortion access,"" Moore said. ""This constitutional amendment will make sure it remains that way, no matter who is in office."" Abortion will also be a major issue in all 50 states when Americans go to the polls to cast their votes in the 2024 presidential election. Many expect President Joe Biden to make abortion rights a key focus of his reelection campaign. And among Republicans, former Vice President Mike Pence has championed increasing restrictions on abortions as he has sought to distance himself from his fellow Republican 2024 hopefuls as the most conservative in the crowded field. Other Republican candidates, like former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson have expressed support for a federal 15-week ban on abortion. A recent USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll found that 1 in 4 Americans said state efforts to ban abortion have made them more supportive of abortion access. While the poll found that Americans ranked abortion as their fifth most important issue going into the 2024 election ? below inflation, immigration, threats to democracy and gun control ? it will undoubtedly remain a significant debate as the 2024 campaign picks up steam. Many states have enacted near-total bans on abortion since the Supreme Court's ruling last year. Other states have imposed strict gestational limits for abortion. Here are the states where most abortions are banned: ? Alabama ? Arkansas ? Idaho ? Kentucky ? Louisiana ? Mississippi ? Missouri ? North Dakota ? Oklahoma ? South Dakota ? Tennessee ? Texas ? West Virginia ? Wisconsin Other states have passed legislation to further strengthen legal protections for abortion. Here is a list of states where abortion remains legal with increased protections: ? California ? Colorado ? Connecticut ? Delaware ? Hawaii ? Illinois ? Maine ? Maryland ? Massachusetts ? Michigan ? Minnesota ? Nevada ? New Jersey ? New Mexico ? New York ? Oregon ? Pennsylvania ? Rhode Island ? Vermont ? Washington",USA

Biden pleaded not guilty to two misdemeanor charges he failed to pay his taxes in 2017 and 2018, when he received more than $1.5 million each year.?Biden told the court a third party paid the back taxes along with interest and fees pursuant to a personal loan he has not began to repay.? The plea deal had also covered a gun charge and would have allowed him to enter a pretrial diversion program that could eventually wipe the charge off the record. But prosecutors and defense lawyers disagreed about the terms of the plea agreement, with Biden insisting any guilty plea encompass immunity from any other criminal charges. Noreika asked the parties to submit legal briefs on the legitimacy of the deals offered to Hunter Biden within 30 days. U.S. Attorney Leo Wise said that would require ordering transcripts of Wednesday's hearing and said 14 days would be sufficient. However, Noreika set no specific date for the next hearing before court adjourned.? The hearing was held in the J. Caleb Boggs Federal Building, named after the former U.S. senator?a young Joe Biden defeated in 1972.? Noreika's postponement of the plea agreement came after Rep. Jason Smith, R-Mo., the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, urged Noreika to reject the plea deal based on the allegations from two IRS investigators of political favoritism in the case. Julianne Murray, chair of the Delaware Republican Party, was in the courtroom Wednesday. She filed a separate?brief on behalf the Heritage Foundation, which claims that it offers ""information that has not, and likely will not, be presented to the Court by either the government or the defendant."" ""I have not had time to review those submissions,"" the judge said, noting it consisted of 900 pages. The plea agreement aimed to resolve a five-year investigation into Hunter Biden. The case remains a flashpoint for Republican investigations into Hunter Biden and his father, President Joe Biden. Republicans have questioned the sources of Hunter Biden¡¯s income and accused him of peddling influence with his father for foreign companies. The White House has dismissed the allegations as baseless innuendo. Here is what we know: White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre responded to questions shortly after the decision. ""Hunter Biden is a private citizen, and this was a personal matter for him,"" she said Wednesday afternoon. ""As we have said, the president, the first lady, they love their son, and they support him as he continues to rebuild his life."" She said the case was handled independently and by a prosecutor appointed by former President Donald Trump, referring other questions to the Department of Justice and Hunter Biden's legal team. As Hunter Biden's plea deal fell apart ? at least temporarily ? Republicans on Capitol Hill ran a victory lap. ¡°He thought he was pleading to get rid of everything and they said, ¡®No, it¡¯s only the tax evasions, not the Foreign Agent Registration Act, money laundering, and the other stuff,¡¯¡± said Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., chair of the House Oversight and Accountability Committee investigating the Biden family.¡°The only thing is I'm glad that people see that what I've said for weeks is true, that there is an ongoing investigation of the entire family,¡± Comer added. There hasn't been any evidence yet to substantiate GOP claims linking President Biden to his son's legal challenges. Other Republicans continued their criticism of the plea deal that dissolved in court Wednesday afternoon, when it was put on hold by a federal judge. ¡°The plea deal is an absolute disgrace,¡± Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said.¡°It is a sweetheart deal designed by the Biden Justice Department to give Hunter Biden a slap on the wrist and its principal objective is protecting Joe Biden and insulating him from his own involvement and corruption selling access to foreign nationals,¡± Cruz added. ¡°I don¡¯t think that it was a good deal for the American public. I think it was clear he was getting favored treatment because he¡¯s the president¡¯s son and they¡¯re trying to close down and shut down the investigations into the Biden (family),¡± Rep. Harriet Hageman, R-Wyo., a member of the House Judiciary Committee, told USA TODAY Wednesday. Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., pointed to last week¡¯s high-profile hearings in the House with two whistleblowers from the Internal Revenue Service who alleged the Department of Justice interfered with the federal investigation into Hunter Biden. Lawler said Congress is yet to be done investigating Hunter Biden¡¯s case. ¡°You have numerous whistleblowers right now coming forward and saying (interference) occurred. These are not Republican whistleblowers by the way, these are Democrats. These are registered Democrats coming forward and saying this is a problem,¡± Lawler told reporters Wednesday. Hunter Biden will hold a press conference Wednesday after his court appearance in Delaware, marking his first public reaction to federal tax charges and an anticipated plea deal. The president's son is expected to avoid jail time, but is facing mounting pressure from President Joe Biden's political enemies in the House GOP, which tried to intervene in the case and asked the judge to reject the plea deal. You can watch the press conference here when it begins: Biden is set to plead guilty to receiving $1.5 million in taxable income each year in 2017 and 2018 and failing to pay more than $100,000 in taxes each of those years, according to a prosecution letter that announced the charges. Each charge carries a maximum 12 months in prison, but prosecutors are expected to recommend probation, according to The Associated Press. The judge, Noreika, will determine the sentence. The gun charge, which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison, alleges Biden made a false statement on a federal form when he bought a gun in 2018. The?Gun Control Act prohibits drug users from possessing firearms. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives ruled the ban applies to?""a conviction for use or possession of a controlled substance within the past year."" Biden filled out a federal form when he bought a handgun in October 2018 in which he replied ¡°no¡± to a question of whether he was ¡°an unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any depressant, stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance,""?according to the Washington Post. By his own account in his memoir ¡°Beautiful Things,¡±?Biden battled drug addiction and for periods during 2018 smoked crack ¡°every 15 minutes.¡± ""I know Hunter believes it is important?to take responsibility for these mistakes he made during a period of turmoil and addiction in his life,¡± said Clark, Biden¡¯s lawyer. ¡°He looks forward to continuing his recovery and moving forward."" A plea deal is a negotiation between a defendant and a prosecutor in which a defendant agrees to plead guilty to one or several offenses in exchange for a lenient punishment from the prosecutor, according to the Cornell Legal Information Institute. The prosecutor can agree to reduce the number or severity of a charge, thus allowing them to ¡°to focus their time and resources on other cases,¡± according to the institute. But ultimately it is the judge¡¯s decision on how to punish a defendant. Scholars estimate that about 90% to 95% of federal and state court cases are resolved through plea deals, according to the Department of Justice. U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika, who is overseeing Hunter Biden¡¯s tax and gun cases, was appointed by former President Donald Trump and confirmed with bipartisan support in the Senate. The Senate confirmed her appointment in August 2018 by voice vote, suggesting her nomination wasn¡¯t controversial. Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., has cited her appointment as an example of bipartisanship and how the system should work. Noreika has a bachelor¡¯s degree from Lehigh University, her master¡¯s is from Columbia University and her law degree is from the University of Pittsburgh. She was a lawyer in private practice in Wilmington for 25 years before Trump appointed her to the bench. Republican lawmakers on the House Oversight and Accountability Committee are investigating who bought Hunter Biden¡¯s paintings and how much they paid as part of a wide-ranging inquiry into Biden¡¯s business dealings and bank records.? The art was initially listed as $500,000 a piece and now range from $50,000 to $25,000. Rep. James Comer, the chairman of the committee, called the figures ¡°exorbitant¡± and questioned whether Biden was using the art to influence foreign adversaries. The questions about the art sales grew in 2021 and the White House announced then that all sales would be handled through a dealer without the president or his son knowing.? Jessica Bengels is the lawyer at Latham and Watkins in New York City who contacted the U.S. District Court clerk¡¯s office to ask about how to seal filings in Hunter Biden¡¯s tax case, according to a court filing. Bengels, a lawyer who worked 18 years at the firm, provided a statement saying she hadn¡¯t worked on the case other than to research on the docket how to file electronically. She said she called the clerk¡¯s office Tuesday to ask how to restrict confidential material from the court file and that there may have been some confusion in dealing with two clerks. ¡°I am completely confident that I never indicated I was calling from Mr. Kittila¡¯s firm or that I worked with him in any way,¡± Bengels said. Hunter Biden has a number of lawyers representing him in criminal cases, congressional investigations and a recently settled child-support case. Lawyers representing Biden in the tax case are Christopher Clark of Clark Smith Villazor in New York, Richard Jones of Berger Harris in Wilmington and Matthew Salerno of Latham and Watkins in New York. Bengels was helping Salerno with her calls. Other lawyers working on the gun case are Brian McManus and Timothy McCarten of Latham and Watkins in Boston and Washington, respectively. Hunter Biden graduated high school in 1988 from Archmere Academy, a private Catholic prep school in Delaware and the alma mater of his father. He graduated from Georgetown University in 1992 with a bachelors of arts degree in history. He spent a year as a member of the Jesuit Volunteer Corps, where he met his first wife, and later received his law degree from Yale University in 1996. Hunter Biden, 53, is the youngest and only living son of President Joe Biden and Neilia Hunter, who died in a car crash in 1972. He married Melissa Cohen, a 37-year-old South African filmmaker, in 2019 after a 24-year-long marriage with Kathleen Buhle, whom he divorced in 2017. Biden has five children, ranging in age from 29 to 3. He has three daughters with Buhle: Naomi Biden, 29; Finnegan Biden, 23; and Maisy Biden, 21. He has a 4-year-old daughter with Lunden Roberts and a 3-year-old son with Cohen. Two Internal Revenue Service investigators ? Greg Shapley and Joseph Ziegler ? told Congress last week that Justice Department officials hamstrung the inquiry. ""It appeared to me, based on what I experienced, that the U.S. attorney in Delaware in our investigation was constantly hamstrung, limited and marginalized by (Justice Department) officials as well as other U.S. attorneys,"" Ziegler told three committees that held a joint hearing. Shapley said he was prevented from following certain leads that could have potentially led investigators to the president. The chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, the panel that oversees the IRS and participated in the hearing, argued Tuesday the judge should reject the plea deal because of political interference in the investigation. The filing from Rep. Jason Smith, R-Mo., said Biden ¡°appears to have benefited from political interference which calls into question the propriety of the investigation of the U.S. Attorney¡¯s Office.¡± Smith¡¯s lawyer, Theodore Kittila, asked the judge to consider witness testimony and other exhibits he submitted. Biden¡¯s lawyers argued the exhibits posted with excerpts of the IRS testimony contained personal information about Biden that should be refiled and remain confidential. But Kittila said the information was already publicly available through records at the congressional committee. At some point Tuesday, a lawyer at the firm representing Biden called the court, allegedly identified herself as working with Kittila and asked to seal the records, according to a narrative of events the judge outlined in the court docket. The contested documents were taken down from public view while the judge considers the arguments. ""It appears that the caller misrepresented her identity and who she worked for in an attempt to improperly convince the Clerk's Office to remove the amicus materials from the docket,"" the order stated, commanding Biden's attorneys explain why the court shouldn't consider sanctions for ""misrepresentations to the court.""? In another filing, a lawyer from Biden¡¯s legal team, Matthew Salerno, wrote that another attorney from his office was responsible for the phone call, that the attorney in question properly identified herself and the situation ""stems from an unfortunate and unintentional miscommunication between a staff member at our firm and employees of the court."" House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., called the plea agreement a ""sweetheart deal"" and Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., called it a ""slap on the wrist."" Both men have said the charges will continue to fuel congressional investigations of the Biden family alleged foreign influence peddling before the 2024 election. ¡°Hunter Biden is getting away with a slap on the wrist when growing evidence uncovered by the House Oversight Committee reveals the Bidens engaged in a pattern of corruption, influence peddling, and possibly bribery,¡± Comer, chair of the House Oversight and Accountability Committee, said in a tweet. Donald Trump, who has been indicted on federal charges alleging he mishandled classified documents and New York state charges alleging his falsified business records, argued the judicial system is broken. ""Wow!¡± Trump posted on Truth Social. ¡°The corrupt Biden DOJ just cleared up hundreds of years of criminal liability by giving Hunter Biden a mere 'traffic ticket.'"" The White House has dismissed the inquiries as ""made up stunt 'investigations.'"" Biden's lawyer, Christopher Clark,?has said his understanding is that the agreements resolve the government's five-year investigation of Hunter Biden. Hunter Biden's legal team clashed with prominent Republican political leaders over the past several weeks in response to Republican attacks on the character of the president's son.? Hunter Biden's lawyer Abbe Lowell sent former President Donald Trump, the leading 2024 Republican presidential candidate, a cease and desist letter after Trump criticized Biden's plea deal in a post on Truth Social. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., was also targeted by Biden's lawyers last week after she displayed sexually explicit photos of Biden during a congressional hearing. Lowell requested that a congressional ethics panel take action against Greene in a letter sent to the Office of Congressional Ethics.? Biden's lawyer sent a similar letter about Greene to the Office of Congressional Ethics in April, accusing Greene of spreading ""unhinged rhetoric"" about Biden.? David Weiss, the U.S. attorney for Delaware who was appointed by Trump, denied the Justice Department retaliated against IRS investigators on the case. Weiss also said he was allowed to pursue the investigation unhindered. ¡°I have been granted ultimate authority over this matter, including responsibility for deciding where, when and whether to file charges and for making decisions necessary to preserve the integrity of the prosecution, consistent with federal law, the Principles of Federal Prosecution, and Departmental regulations,¡± Weiss wrote to lawmakers. The Justice Department offered to make Weiss available for a House Judiciary Committee hearing after Congress' August break, to answer questions about how the investigation was handled. ¡°The Department believes it is strongly in the public interest for the American people and for Congress to hear directly from U.S. Attorney Weiss on these assertions and questions about his authority at a public hearing,¡± Assistant Attorney General Carlos Uriarte wrote to the chairman, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio. The criminal cases come after Hunter Biden settled a child support case in Arkansas last month with the mother of one of his daughters. Biden had sought to reduce the $20,000 per month in child support he was paying for the girl born Aug. 28, 2018, to Lunden Roberts. The amount of child support agreed upon was redacted from the court filing. Biden will continue reimbursing Roberts for the cost of the girl¡¯s health insurance and the girl multiple paintings. His paintings have been listed with sale prices as high as $500,000.",USA

Mata-Rubio, 34, is seeking to succeed Mayor Don McLaughlin, who is stepping down after nearly 10 years leading the city to pursue a seat in the Texas House. A special election for mayor will be held on Nov. 7. Mata-Rubio made the announcement on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter.

Uvalde shooting aftermath:Mental health, safety investments promised after Uvalde shooting show little headway A lifelong Uvalde resident who works in advertising at the Uvalde Leader News, Mata-Rubio graduated from St. Mary's University in San Antonio last December with a bachelor's degree in public history. Mata-Rubio is among several Uvalde parents who have advocated at the state and federal levels for gun safety reform after 19 students and two teachers were killed by an 18-year-old man at Robb Elementary School. The gunman opened fire in a classroom with an assault rifle he had purchased legally. The law enforcement response to the shooting has been roundly criticized after 400 armed officers arrived to the school and hesitated outside of the classroom for more than an hour before confronting the gunman. But those gun reform efforts, which include banning assault rifles or raising the age to buy one to 21, were unsuccessful in the Texas Legislature. Mata-Rubio told the newspaper Uvalde had become ""stagnant"" and that the city's leadership became ""comfortable, which led to the events that unfolded on May 24, 2022."" ""The aftermath has added to the trauma of a grieving and fractured community. It is my hope to bridge the gap because only when we come together can we evolve to something greater,"" she told the newspaper. The election will be Mata-Rubio's first time seeking elected office, the newspaper reported. If elected, Mata-Rubio would become the first woman and third Hispanic mayor of Uvalde.

A divided Supreme Court on Tuesday backed a Biden administration effort to regulate ¡°ghost guns,¡± temporarily allowing the government to require manufacturers of the untraceable?weapon kits to conduct background checks on customers and mark their products with serial numbers. Ghost gun kits allow people to purchase parts that can be built into a weapon without the usual regulations that come with an assembled gun. President Joe Biden last year required companies selling the do-it-yourself kits to adhere to the same rules as other gunmakers, such as keeping records that help police trace the weapons. The Supreme Court agreed 5-4 on Tuesday to pause a lower court's ruling, allowing the Biden administration to enforce the rule while the underlying case continues. Justice Amy Coney Barrett and Chief Justice John Roberts, both conservatives, sided with the court's three-member liberal wing to keep the Biden rule in place for now. Four other conservative justices ? Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh ? said they would have temporarily blocked enforcement of the rule. As is often the case on its emergency docket, the high court issued only a short order and did not explain its reasoning. So-called ""ghost guns"" are often kits sold on-line that allow purchasers to assemble parts into a functioning weapon. Gun control advocates see the kits as a dangerous loophole and point out that police frequently find the weapons at crime scenes. The Biden administration told the Supreme Court that law enforcement agencies submitted 1,600 ghost guns to federal authorities for tracing in 2017. Four years later, that number had increased to more than 19,000. Those tracing requests were largely futile, the administration says, because the kits do not carry serial numbers. ""These guns are weapons of choice for many criminals,"" Biden said last year. ""We are going to do everything we can to deprive them of that choice and,?when we find them, put them in jail for a long, long time."" More:How a Second Amendment case at the Supreme Court is putting gun rights groups in a jam Gun owners, advocacy groups and companies that make or distribute the products sued. They told the Supreme Court that Biden overstepped his authority by defining ¡°firearm¡± to include the kits. Rather than ¡°take matters into its own hands,¡± the plaintiffs say, the administration should have tried to convince Congress to change the law. Eleven states, including Illinois, California and New York, have regulations on ghost guns in place intended to curb their use,?according to the gun control advocacy group Everytown. White House spokesperson Olivia Dalton said the Supreme Court's order ""will keep in place important efforts?to combat the surge of unserialized, privately-made 'ghost guns' which have proliferated?in?crime scenes across the country."" Cody Wisniewski, a lawyer for the Firearms Policy Coalition, said the gun rights group was ""deeply disappointed"" in the order but said the group is ""still confident that we will yet again defeat ATF and its unlawful rule"" when lower courts review the case on the merits. A U.S. District Court in Texas blocked the regulation from covering ghost guns in June. The Louisiana-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit declined to pause the lower court's ruling. The Biden administration then filed an emergency appeal at the Supreme Court late last month. The Supreme Court's ruling arrived on its ""shadow docket,"" where such emergency cases are handled. The court did not decide whether the rule is legal. Rather, the court allowed the regulation to stand while the case continues. The nation¡¯s highest court is already set to consider a significant Second Amendment later this year: A challenge to a federal law that prohibits Americans subject to domestic violence orders from possessing a gun. A Texas man is appealing his conviction under that law in a case that could have sweeping implications for other gun regulations.",USA

A lawman¡¯s vow to take the first-ever mug shot of a former U.S. president. A region known for its violent extremist groups and a state's lax gun control laws. These are some of the reasons the security scenarios for Donald Trump's fourth criminal case, expected any day now in Fulton County, Georgia, could play out far differently than the ones in New York, Miami and Washington, D.C. The former president already has been through so many indictments that what was once considered historic and extraordinary ? his subsequent arrest and criminal arraignment ? has now become almost routine: The front-running Republican candidate for reelection in 2024 arrives in his Secret Service motorcade and is escorted with his lawyers into a courtroom under heavy security. He enters a plea of not guilty, gets back in his armored limo and is driven away. But Fulton County, which includes the state capital, Atlanta, has long been a uniquely critical flashpoint in terms of Trump's alleged schemes to steal the 2020 election, as well as authorities' efforts to push back on them and, later, to investigate what happened. It is also, security analysts say, much more of a hotbed for right-wing extremist groups like the ones that helped foment the Capitol insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021 by riling up a much bigger group of Trump supporters convinced that he had been wronged. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis and Sheriff Patrick Labat have established what they say is arguably the biggest preventive security dragnet in the area since the 1996 Olympics. In interviews and public statements, they said they believe the extraordinary level of security they're putting in place will be enough to handle any contingencies. In interviews with USA TODAY, county officials and security experts for the most part agreed. But they said authorities are smart to be bracing for trouble at the courthouse and adjacent Fulton Government Center, and on several fronts. On Friday July 28, Willis warned her prosecutors to ¡°stay alert¡± given the increasing wave of threats she and the office were receiving. One email had the subject line ¡°Fani Willis = Corrupt N*¡± and said, ¡°You are going to fail, you Jim Crow Democrat whore.¡± Trump himself lashed out at Willis at a campaign rally Tuesday, calling her a ""young racist in Atlanta"" and falsely claiming she had an affair with ""the leader of a gang"" she was prosecuting. And she now plans to indict him, he said, on bogus charges so she can run for higher office. ""What's going on in this country is..."" Trump said, trailing off. And on Wednesday, FBI agents in Utah shot and killed a man who they say made threats against President Joe Biden and Alvin Bragg, the Manhattan District Attorney?who is prosecuting Trump for alleged hush-money payments to adult film actress Stormy Daniels during the 2016 presidential campaign. ""CLEANING THE DUST OFF THE M24 SNIPER RIFLE,"" Provo resident Craig Deleeuw Robertson, 75, said on Facebook, citing Biden's visit to Utah Wednesday night, the FBI said.? Here's why what's happening in Fulton County: Criminal charges in the case, including for Trump and numerous alleged co-conspirators, are likely. Willis said a week and a half ago that she¡¯ll announce charging decisions by Sept. 1. ¡°The work is accomplished,¡± she told CNN affiliate WXIA. ¡°We¡¯ve been working for 2¨ö years. We¡¯re ready to go.¡± In recent days, the road in front of the Fulton County Courthouse in downtown Atlanta has been closed to traffic. Orange barricades and other barriers ring the building, and local, state and even federal authorities have become a visible presence in the area. On Monday, NBC News reported, a bomb-sniffing dog was brought in to inspect media vehicles. In another sign of looming indictments, Willis has asked the majority of her staff to work remotely rather than at the courthouse. More:Witnesses in Georgia Trump probe suspected of lying, raising more questions in closely watched inquiry Labat, too, has been preparing for the indictment of the former president for months, he said in a recent media briefing. That includes sending representatives to Trump¡¯s indictments in New York and Miami to see how authorities there handled the crowd and potential protests. Labat¡¯s deputies are working with local, state and federal law enforcement agencies to make sure normal services remain open and operational at the courthouse and government center ¡°for those we actually service¡± if and when a Trump arraignment comes. And Trump would be treated differently in Atlanta than he has been during his past three arraignments ? but just the same as any other criminal defendant being processed into the Fulton County criminal justice system, Labat vowed. ¡°It doesn¡¯t matter your status,¡± he said. ¡±We have a mug shot ready for you. ¡°Unless someone tells me differently,¡± he added, ¡°we are following our normal practices.¡± Willis, who is Black, has confirmed publicly that she has received numerous and serious threats ? including racist and menacing phone calls ? because of her aggressive investigation into Trump and a number of alleged co-conspirators. By January 2022, ¡°alarming¡± rhetoric from Trump prompted her to ask the FBI Atlanta field office for a risk assessment of the courthouse. Enhanced security measures were put in, and Willis herself reportedly began traveling with bodyguards. Across the street from the courthouse is the Georgia state Capitol building, where armed and angry Trump supporters gathered after his 2020 election loss in response to his false claims of fraud. Trump himself has ratcheted up the rhetoric, pointedly and repeatedly calling Willis a racist, and even ¡°mentally sick.¡± He has also used his campaign rallies to single out others for criticism and encourage protests, including against Willis. Labat disclosed at the briefing that his office has investigated dozens of threats, and not just against Willis but against himself and unnamed judges and others, too. ¡°The threats have been many,¡± he said. ¡°They started via email, via text messages, via personal phone calls.¡± ¡°When you make a threat, when you become a keyboard bully, it¡¯s our goal to really come and hold you accountable,¡± Labat added, for threats against ""the DA, the judges and everybody that has received those threats."" Natalie Ammons, director of communications for the Fulton County Sheriff¡¯s Office, told USA TODAY she couldn¡¯t discuss details of the status of the ongoing investigations. ¡°They¡¯re doing threat assessments, they¡¯re conducting a criminal investigation, that's all I can say,¡± Ammons said in an interview. ¡°Any and all of the threats are being reviewed.¡± Ammons said she could not discuss specifics about the nature of the threats, including how many were believed to be ongoing. In general terms, she said, ¡°they range from hate speech to First Amendment protected comments. Some are actually very threatening. A lot of them have been directed to the DA¡± for her protection and for possible prosecution. Willis launched the sprawling investigation in early 2021 into whether Trump and allies in the state, in Washington, D.C., and elsewhere engaged in ¡°coordinated attempts to unlawfully alter the outcome of the 2020 elections.¡± At the center of that inquiry is a phone call Trump made to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger in which he asked him to ¡°find¡± 11,780 votes, or one more than Joe Biden received in winning the state. Trump and associates also have been linked to numerous other alleged schemes at the center of state and federal election fraud investigations and, in the case of Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith, a federal indictment on conspiracy charges. The special congressional committee investigating Jan. 6 concluded that Trump also was implicated in a scheme by his lawyers to create false slates of electors who would cast Georgia's electoral votes for the former president instead of for Biden, as the state¡¯s voters intended. Eight of the alleged fake electors?have since agreed to immunity deals with Fulton County prosecutors, court filings show. A special grand jury Willis impaneled ultimately heard testimony from at least 75 witnesses and issued a detailed report in which it recommended indicting?more than a dozen people, its foreperson said in interviews with various media outlets. ¡°It is not a short list,¡± the forewoman, Emily Kohrs, told The New York Times.Asked if jurors had recommended indicting Trump, she declined to answer directly but said: ¡°You¡¯re not going to be shocked. It¡¯s not rocket science.¡± In another interview, she hinted that at least some of those recommended for indictment were household names people would recognize. In a partial version of the report released in February, the Fulton County jurors also said they found possible evidence of perjury by ¡°one or more¡± witnesses who testified before them. Ultimately, it is up to Willis to decide whether there is enough evidence to bring the case to a regular grand jury and seek criminal indictments. She has hinted broadly that she will pursue charges under the state¡¯s RICO laws, short for the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act statute that¡¯s often used against organized crime families and other complex and long-running conspiracies. Trump¡¯s first three indictments and arraignments prompted little in the way of organized protests or mass violence like that in Washington on Jan. 6. Crowds, in fact, have appeared to be split between supporters and those opposing Trump. But Amy Cooter, research director for Middlebury Institute of International Studies¡¯ Center on Terrorism, Extremism and Counterterrorism, told USA TODAY she is more worried about an Atlanta arraignment. First, she said, the district attorney¡¯s investigation into potential election fraud and interference has been very high-profile and has inflamed Trump supporters in the state and surrounding region for more than a year. Many of them believe Trump¡¯s repeated claims that the Georgia investigation, perhaps even more so than the others, is politically motivated given Willis¡¯s stature as a high-profile Democrat. Cooter, who lurks anonymously in right-wing chat rooms and forums, said she hasn¡¯t seen enough evidence that extremists, including from well-established local and regional militias and neo-Nazi groups, are upset enough about Trump¡¯s legal problems to do anything just yet. ¡°I¡¯m not watching every corner of the internet or every group, but I think that among the folks I'm watching, they're less concerned about indictments,¡± Cooter said. ¡°They're more concerned about upcoming potential trials, and especially hypothetical guilty verdicts."" ¡°But that said, I do think Georgia has the potential to be a bigger flashpoint than some of the other indictments just because of the how big of a focus Georgia was during the last election and how so many people there were convinced that the election was stolen and that Georgia was crucial for what should have been a Trump win,¡± Cooter said. Cooter said she is also concerned because Trump¡¯s constant claims of a rigged election and his ¡°Stop the Steal¡± campaign after his loss have turned the region, and Georgia especially, into more of a hotbed of extremism than they already were. ¡°Historically, we've seen more militia activity in the Midwestern states with some other hot spots,¡± she said. ¡°But in recent years, especially in the latter half of the Trump administration, certain places in the South became more important ? I would say Florida as a whole and then Georgia, especially around the whole ¡®Stop the Steal¡¯ rhetoric.¡± There has been a regional surge in ¡°militia groups across the board,¡± Cooter said, including local community militia groups and, in the run-up to Jan. 6, members of the Three Percenters and Oath Keepers, some of whom faced charges in connection with the insurrection. ¡°We've also seen various different neo-Nazi groups who have had an apparent resurgence in those places¡± who could conceivably converge on Atlanta, Cooter said. Robert D¡¯Amico, a Florida-based former FBI agent, said local, state and federal authorities are working closely together in Fulton County to make sure they can handle anything that comes their way. ¡°The fact that they sent people down to Miami to look at how they did it shows me that they're pretty far ahead in their planning¡± and in gaming out security scenarios, said D¡¯Amico, founder of the security firm Sierra One Consulting. He said that in line with protocol for major events, a 24-hour command post is probably being set up with officials from various law enforcement agencies. But D¡¯Amico also said the city and surrounding area present a different and potentially more serious set of problems than any of the places where Trump has been indicted and arraigned. One concern is the relatively lax gun laws in Georgia, made even less stringent last year, that allow potential protesters ? or people with worse intentions ? to carry concealed weapons even if they don¡¯t have a permit. That could pose a nightmare for security officials, especially if a large crowd turns out. ¡°There¡¯s definitely a bigger issue with far-right groups in Georgia ? maybe not downtown Atlanta, but fairly close¡± when compared to Miami, New York and Washington, D¡¯Amico said. A related concern is if some members of these groups rally a larger crowd of protesters, as was the case on Jan. 6. ¡°It's lighting that fire, that igniting people that probably weren't there to do anything with intent,¡± he said. ¡°But they get all fired up, and you have a good speaker who really gets these groups going, and that's when you can have an issue.¡± It¡¯s possible given the makeup of local extremist groups, D¡¯Amico said, that right-wing protesters could clash with left-wing, or Antifa, protesters, as was the case at the ¡°Unite the Right¡± rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017. ¡°So I would say there's definitely concern and there should be concern,¡± D¡¯Amico said. ¡°But until we have a date and time (of charges filed) you're not going to be able to really put a good metric on that concern because there's so many different things that could potentially happen.¡±",USA
https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/08/11/how-old-is-mitch-mcconnell/70504666007/,2023-08-11,"'In office longer than we've been alive': Voters say why age matters to them for McConnell, Biden, more","When Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell stopped speaking midsentence for a full 28 seconds during a July press conference, it startled constituents like Michael Frazier. Frazier, a native of Powell County, Kentucky, which is in the notoriously impoverished eastern half of the state, said his first thoughts were about the longtime senator¡¯s well-being, but then quickly pivoted to McConnell's importance. The 81-year-old senator is a Washington villain in the minds of most national liberals, but he has remained in office for nearly four decades, in part, by always touting his role in bringing major federal resources to the region, such as when $300 million in federal funding went toward Eastern Kentucky flood relief. McConnell is an indispensable public official in the eyes of conservative-leaning voters such as Frazier, who said the GOP leader has allowed the Bluegrass State and rural communities like his to punch well above their political weight. ""So anytime something does happen with Sen. McConnell, we do have a worry because we know that the things that McConnell can do for us cannot be replicated by a freshman senator,"" he said. Frazier, 32, who serves as political director of the Kentucky Young Republican Federation, said McConnell hasn't shown signs of losing any cognitive abilities since freezing up and impressed the GOP faithful when he appeared at the state's annual Fancy Farm picnic in early August. ""I think that McConnell is more than capable of continuing to be the leader,"" Frazier said. Other young GOP activists, however, argue the Republican leader's latest episode underscores a debate about how U.S. elected officials, including President Joe Biden, are staying on the public stage too long. Those constituents, who are more liberty-minded conservatives, point out that older lawmakers are saddling their generation with multiple crises from the national debt to climate change. ""Voters have the right to elect whoever they view as the best individual, however, it is my view that Mitch McConnell does need to retire,"" TJ Roberts, 24, a recent law graduate who serves on the executive board of the Northern Kentucky Young Republicans, told USA TODAY. ""Young people are particularly aggrieved at this point by intergenerational senators who have been in office longer than we've been alive."" Across the partisan divide, Americans are dealing with the sensitive political topic of how old is too old for U.S. elected leaders to be as we face the critical 2024 election. Biden, 80, is the main engine of that conversation as online memes and cable news commentary by opponents fuels a larger skepticism about his ability to run a marathon reelection campaign. Voters and experts tell USA TODAY the age question is coming up more often as a result and cannot be ignored, but how to address those concerns ? from term limits and retirement demands to younger candidates and competency tests ? varies as the country faces many generational crises. Natalie Graves, a 52-year-old mental health therapist who lives in Chicago, said the age of U.S. elected officials is brought up a lot more in conversation with her neighbors, friends and family than in years past. ""My husband and I, we talk about it often that we need some young blood in there ? absolutely,"" she said. Just this week, gun control activist David Hogg, a survivor of the Parkland, Florida, massacre launched a new political action committee dubbed?""Leaders We Deserve"" which is vowing to ""elect young, fearless progressives"" who are under age 35 for federal office and under age 30 for state office. Thirty-seven percent of Democratic and independent voters said in a recent?USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll that Biden¡¯s age makes them less likely to vote for him. Graves, a registered Democrat, isn't among them but she said mental capacity matters, adding that each official in the news as of late should be looked at separately. She said she believes Biden appears to be functioning well whereas McConnell is diminishing and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, of California, is in the worst shape. ""Feinstein should have been gone,"" Graves said. ""Whatever her conditions are, they're so apparent it's just irresponsible at this point for her to stay."" Feinstein, 90, has been dogged by calls from progressive lawmakers to resign over the past year after being sidelined from the Senate with shingles?for three months. The California Democrat, who was briefly hospitalized on Tuesday after she suffered a fall at home, has been confused when taking certain votes amid reports that she's turned her power of attorney over to her daughter. Julianne Reiser, a 57-year-old bookkeeper who lives in Burbank, California, said her senator's condition ""isn't a good look"" for the Golden State or the country. She compared approaching the concern about a politician's age to the difficult talks families have about the lifestyle of elderly members. ""You have Silent Generation people who are now in their 80s and so people like me, we have these conversations in our own home: 'when can we have the conversation about taking mom's car keys away?'"" she said. ""So we're being forced as a country to confront the same things that families have had to confront in private."" Reiser, a registered Democrat, added how many people who are age 80 and older are, ""sharp as a tack."" She said rather than imposing an age limit or testing a candidate's mental capacity ? as Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley suggested earlier this year Reiser, a registered Democrat, added how many people who are age 80 and older are, ""sharp as a tack."" She said rather than imposing an age limit or testing a candidate's mental capacity ? as Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley suggested earlier this year Reiser, a registered Democrat, added how many people who are age 80 and older are, ""sharp as a tack."" She said rather than imposing an age limit or testing a candidate's mental capacity ? as Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley suggested earlier this year ? a better idea would be term limits. ""I don't want to push out anyone who is still passionate about their job with the wit to do their job, but I do think that mental capacity becomes a question after a certain age or really at any age,"" she said. America¡¯s political leaders are much older than other national leaders, including in most democracies where elected officials tend to be younger than in autocratic countries. Biden, who made history as the oldest U.S. president ever elected, is now the ninth oldest leader in the world, according to an analysis by the Pew Research Center. To put that in perspective, the median age of world leaders is 62, which is two decades younger than the 80-year-old Biden. In terms of Congress, the U.S. Senate is the seventh oldest legislative body in the world with a median age of 64, according to a study by the Inter-Parliamentary Union. The U.S. House, where members can be as young as 25 under the Constitution, is relatively speaking spry median age of 58, the group found. Matthew Dallek, a political historian at George Washington University, said age by itself isn't a disqualification for most American voters who often cast their ballot based on a person's performance. But as reports about the health of older elected officials persist, he said age will become a larger issue going into 2024. ""Politics and these campaigns are often about the future,"" Dallek said. ""And there is a reason why American voters have tended to prefer younger, seemingly more vigorous candidates. It represents a passing of the torch to a new generation."" McConnell was received warmly by Republicans when he surprised political observers by attending the state¡¯s famed ? and rowdy ? political festival this year where he was taunted with chants to ""retire"" by Democrats. ""Well, this is my 28th Fancy Farm, and I want to assure you, it's not my last,"" McConnell said at a GOP breakfast last weekend. Frazier, the young Kentucky Republican activist, said it's never been wise to bet against McConnell, a Polio survivor, and that most believe in his judgment to stiff arm calls to step down by opponents, even within the national GOP ranks. ""It's his history that gives me faith in him,"" he said. But Frazier admits that the latest health scares mean there needs to be a public acknowledgment that McConnell won't be around forever. He said behind-the-scenes many conversations with friends and political allies are about what and who comes next. ""It's worrisome,¡± he said. ¡°You think about not only just the now but also the future."" Outside of the Bluegrass State, other conservative-leaning voters who don't view McConnell as essential to the national party's future said he has been instrumental in stiff-arming Democratic policies and appointments, but think it's time for someone else to take hold of the Senate GOP steering wheel, especially as Republicans are eager to take back the upper chamber and White House next year. ""(McConnell) needs to step back and spend time with his family and let somebody else in there that will seemingly be more active,"" said Thomas Gleaves, a 60-year-old gate designer from Rowlett, Texas. Gleaves, a registered Republican, said regardless of party affiliation or age, Americans want elected officials who project strength to the rest of the world. He said McConnell and Biden are past their prime, adding how the president ""looks feeble"" when speaking publicly compared to former President Donald Trump, who is 77 years old. ""If they're 70 or 80 years old and they're able to walk up and down steps and hold their chest out, and be very frank and stern,"" Gleaves said. ""You know, Donald Trump is older, but he has that and if there's a better Republican that's going to run this time, I'll listen to what they have to say."" Other voters say this debate is a reflection of how each of us must eventually deal with slowing down. Donald Isherwood, a 77-year-old produce farmer who lives in central Wisconsin, said older Americans can offer a wisdom and experience that remains valuable. ""There's the old tradition of listening to the elders that has a place in history, has a place in society,"" he said. Isherwood, a former Republican who is now a registered independent, said there isn't a definitive answer about what Biden, McConnell, or Feinstein should do. Eventually, however, every country must turn to new leadership, comparing it to how he relinquished day-to-day farm duties to others. ""They do have purpose. I still have a purpose on the farm, but it's not the same,"" he said. ""There is a sense of sensitivity that a president or potential candidate or a Senate majority leader should feel in themselves to ask, am I too old? Am I representative of the body politic? And I think the answer is no, you're not.""",USA
https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/08/29/jacksonville-shooting-fear-among-black-americans/70703933007/,2023-08-29,"'Frightening, shocking': Some Black Americans fear violence after Jacksonville shooting","When MaliVai Washington heard about Saturday¡¯s racist attack ? a mass shooting in Jacksonville, Florida ? his first thought was: Is it someone I know? Washington's MaliVai Washington Youth Foundation, which helps hundreds of Black students attend after-school homework and tennis programs, is less than 2 miles from the Dollar General where three Black people were shot and killed by a white former store employee. ""The shooting is tragic and especially hit close to home,"" said Washington, who in 1996 was the first African-American male tennis player to reach the Wimbledon final since Arthur Ashe in 1975.?? Washington said he was stunned that there are still mass murders that are ¡°purely racially motivated. ... Haven¡¯t we evolved to a point where we¡¯re past that?¡± ¡°It's still frightening and shocking that in this day and age, we still have this in the United States, in my hometown, in my home state.¡° The Jacksonville shooting comes as Black communities are still reeling from other racial attacks, including last year¡¯s killing of 10 Black grocery shoppers in Buffalo, New York, and the murder of nine churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015. Some say they worry media attention and intense rhetoric may have emboldened more extremists. And they worry the racially motivated attacks, which hark back to more violent times in the nation¡¯s history, will continue. Renee Watson, director of the Bexar County small business and entrepreneurship program in San Antonio, said statewide efforts to resist gun control measures and restrict discussion of racism and the effects of slavery in the classroom have heightened fears among communities of color. ¡°As more of these incidents come to pass, people really have to be prepared in their communities,¡± Watson said. ¡°It¡¯s not just in one place. It¡¯s not just in the supermarket. It¡¯s everywhere.¡± Khalil Gibran Muhammad, a historian at the Kennedy School at Harvard University in Massachusetts, said there is a long history of racial strife in Florida, and recent attacks on Black history education in public schools have further fueled concerns about equity and inclusion in Florida.? ¡±For many Black Floridians right now, things feel very much like they've not only gone backward, but that it's a dangerous place,¡¯¡¯ Muhammad said. The Rev. Rhonda Thomas, executive director of Faith in Florida, a coalition of churches advocating for social justice, said many people don¡¯t feel safe.? ""It doesn't end at all, especially here in Florida,"" she said. ""I¡¯ve got a lot of feelings and emotions going on when I see this repeated cycle of hate that I feel has been legislated."" Desmond Meade, president and executive director of the Orlando-based Florida Rights Restoration Coalition, said he feels somewhat ¡°scared¡± as a Black man in Florida.? ¡°It makes you think about the state we¡¯re in. I mean, just to think I could be sitting in a car and someone can shoot me just based on my race, there¡¯s definitely a heightened level of concern,¡± he said. ¡°There has to be a courageous stand taken against this.¡± Thomas said she¡¯s worried the younger generation will not tolerate some of the racial violence their elders did. She pointed to Montgomery, Alabama, where mostly young Black people earlier this month came to the defense of a Black riverboat co-captain who was being beaten by several white men.? ¡°What took place in Alabama was a spirit of liberation,¡¯¡¯ she said. Thomas launched a project last month with about 200 Black churches in Florida that will teach African American history outside the classroom, including in Sunday school. ¡°It¡¯s on the church to teach it raw and real,¡¯¡¯ she said.? 'Walking with our ancestors'Thousands fighting for civil rights attend March on Washington Outside Florida, many Black people have expressed concern about where the United States is headed.? Rep. Bennie Thompson, who headed the hearings on the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol and served as former chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said racial attacks, including the shooting in Jacksonville, are part of a growing trend of violence against Black communities. ""The rise is coming based on evidence from the right, in terms of right-wing extremists targeting not just houses of worship and institutions frequented by African Americans, now they moved it into grocery stores, supermarkets,"" said Thompson, a Democrat from Mississippi who held a hearing last year on threats against historically Black colleges and universities. ¡°It just continues to escalate in violence.¡¯¡¯ There¡¯s data to back up Thompson¡¯s sentiments. The Jacksonville shooting comes about a month after a new study by Tulane University researchers in New Orleans found mass shootings disproportionately target Black people and occur more often in U.S. cities with high Black populations, suggesting structural racism may be at play.? Hate speech has been much more intense since Barack Obama was elected the first Black president more than 10 years ago, Muhammad said. ¡°There's no question that the notion that there are groups in this society that want to protect the interests of the white Christian community has been the major driver for supremacist groups and organizations to gain adherents and more local power that has contributed to a number of issues, including the Jan. 6 insurrection,¡¯¡¯ he said. Kamm Howard, executive director of Reparations United, a Chicago-based organization, said there is no easy solution to racial hatred in the United States.? ¡°Some Americans want us to continue living in a state of fear. There¡¯s a new wave of extremists who are bringing terror right into Black communities,¡± he said. ¡°This has been building and building, and there¡¯s no short answer or quick fix to this.¡± Arthur Reed, founder of Stop the Killing, an organization based in Houston that works to extract people from gang life and into education, said that while hate crimes should prompt caution, they shouldn¡¯t be allowed to frighten Black people. ¡°We cannot let it strike fear into us, because that is what it¡¯s designed to do,¡± Reed said. ¡°I don¡¯t think we can change our daily activities because of these painful acts. We have to remain as we have and make sure we stand on the principles of America that everyone has a right to be here ? including the haters.¡± He noted some shootings have been committed by people gripped by white supremacist ideologies of the far right. ¡°There are people in America that have a mindset that is so sick that they believe civil war is coming,¡± Reed said. ¡°Blacks could care less about that. People are paying attention to their daily lives, holding down employment and keeping a roof over their head. They¡¯re too busy trying to survive than to plot a civil war.¡± He said the rhetoric of former President Donald Trump and the lingering tensions from the Jan. 6 insurrection have fed worries and confusion among the Black community. ¡°Why is there this constant hate for us even after all we¡¯ve been through?¡± Reed said. ¡°We are a people that have moved on. We never tried to overthrow the government. The constant attacks are mind-boggling.¡± 'We have to remain vigilant'HBCU leaders ask Congress for help against bomb threats Some Black business owners are also worried about their safety.? At an outreach event by Watson¡¯s business office Monday morning in Texas, business owners expressed concerns during a presentation by a Bexar County Sheriff¡¯s Department representative about programs that could help increase security. Such worries were higher among retail business owners, Watson said, given their greater accessibility to the public. Some Black business owners, she said, have said they feel compelled to play down their ownership to avoid attention from those who might want to do them harm. ¡°They don¡¯t want to be a target,¡± she said. Thompson noted that the gun used by the killer in Jacksonville was legal there. ¡°In Florida, the only thing that guy did wrong was he started killing people,¡¯¡¯ he said. Thompson said it¡¯s not enough for politicians to show up at the scene of a shooting and express their sympathies when they then turn around and support policies that allow people to go out and buy a gun. ¡°That¡¯s not the answer,¡± he said, adding that, among other things, there should be more legislation reducing access to assault weapons. ¡°For a civilized society, we have to absolutely start the movement of what we need to do to stop this assault on American citizens.¡¯¡¯ ¡®Tell ¡¯em about the dream, Martin!¡¯Memories from the crowd at MLK¡¯s March on Washington Official statistics back up concerns that life has become more dangerous for Black Americans in recent years.? A report this year by national civil rights group Leadership Conference Education Fund found the number of hate crimes has jumped 80% since 2015, with FBI data clearly illustrating that such crimes spike during presidential elections. ¡°From white supremacist and anti-government movements coalescing and moving more into the political mainstream, to conspiracy theories circulating online and public officials amplifying hate, there are few ? if any ? signs that tensions will lessen,¡± the report reads. According to the FBI, there were nearly 13,000 victims of hate crimes in 2021, an 11.6% increase over the previous year. Black people were the most targeted of all groups, accounting for nearly 4,000 of those victims, the agency said in a revised report, with the number of anti-Black incidents rising 14% to 3,277. As such, Blacks account for about 30% of all victims, despite comprising just under 14% of the U.S. population. The statistics reflect just a fraction of actual incidents because many crimes are not reported, and the agency¡¯s initial report, released in December, was criticized for a lack of data collected as the FBI shifted to a new crime-reporting program with slow or non-participation by law enforcement agencies nationwide. The revised report reflects data from nearly 15,000 law enforcement agencies, or about 80% of all such agencies. About a third of Black adults said they were worried daily or nearly daily that they might be threatened or attacked because of their race or identity, according to a Pew Research Center survey in April 2022. In comparison, 21% of Asian American adults and 14% of Hispanic adults felt similarly, while just 4% of white adults reported feeling the same. The survey found that nearly 3 in 10 Black adults (28%) said they had changed their daily routine or schedule in the previous year because of those fears.? Hate crimes and violence against Black people in the United States are not new. The nation¡¯s history has been marred by such attacks, from centuries of slavery to the lynchings of thousands of Black men, women and children in the early 20th century. While many of those attacks happened in the South, there was also racial violence in Northern communities. Many of the attacks were part of a backlash from whites in power, including lawmakers, and happened in the wake of Reconstruction and later the Jim Crow era. Muhammad, of Harvard University, said it struck a chord that while thousands gathered in the nation¡¯s capital Saturday for the 60th anniversary of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, three Black people were killed hours later because of the color of their skin. Many speakers, including lawmakers and civil rights activists, at the march talked about the need to address violence against communities of color and the impact of toxic rhetoric. Many of those comments were aimed at Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is also running for president in the GOP primary. ¡°There's no history of anti-racist struggle in America, Black freedom movements or civil rights history that doesn't connect the dots between political leaders and the kind of hateful and racist behavior that we saw in Jacksonville over the weekend,¡¯¡¯ Muhammad said. ¡°So there's no reason to disassociate those two things at this moment. Gov. Ron DeSantis has made it painstakingly clear that he is not committed to protecting the rights of Black people in Florida when it comes to how their children learn, what their children experience if they happen to be part of the LGBTQ+ community.¡¯¡¯ At a vigil Sunday in Jacksonville, DeSantis condemned the shooting.?""Perpetrating violence of this kind is unacceptable, and targeting people due to their race has no place in this state of Florida,"" DeSantis said.

Desantis¡¯ battle against ¡°woke¡± culture in Florida has included blocking an Advanced Placement African American studies course in high schools and attempting to restrict conversations about race in schools and businesses.? Howard, of Reparations United, said it¡¯s no surprise the latest mass shooting happened in Florida, which he considers ¡°a hotbed¡± right now in large part because of DeSantis¡¯ rhetoric. ¡°DeSantis is a leading voice for an anti-woke movement, and for many that means an anti-Black movement,¡± Howard said. ¡°You can start talking about not teaching history and the other rhetoric, but his ultimate message is ¡®anti-Blackness.¡¯¡±?

The new regulations at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives would clarify the language required for licensed gun sales and when a dealer is ¡°engaged in the business.¡± Biden signed an executive order in March directing DOJ to implement the rules. While most dealers are following the law, an increasing number of individuals are trying to profit in ¡°off-book, illicit sale of firearms,¡± ATF Director Steve Dettelbach said. ""These activities undermine the law, endanger public safety, create significant burdens on law enforcement, and are unfair to the many licensed dealers who make considerable efforts to follow the law,"" he said. The rules came as part of the gun-safety package passed by Congress in the wake of the Uvalde, Texas Robb Elementary School and Buffalo, New York supermarket shootings in spring 2022.? The ATF is attempting to close the so-called ¡°gun show loophole¡± and ¡°Internet loophole¡± where gun hobbyists sell small numbers of firearms without conducting background checks and without logging serial numbers of their sales. Those cross the line into ""for profit"" in several scenarios outlined Thursday including: In the past, gun control groups and Democrats have called for the government to set a number of sales to define ¡°engaged in the business,¡± such as five in a year. Officials said that number was considered, but the proposed rule is based on the language that the seller ¡°predominantly earns a profit¡± from the sales, which is a departure from the former ¡°profit and livelihood¡± standard. Background:Gun used in Odessa shooting shows risk when chain of illegal sale starts with home-based hobbyist dealers Even a single firearm sale under the proposed rule could be deemed ""engaged in the business"" of firearm sales requiring a license, when combined with other evidence under the new ATF framework. The laws nudges the rules closer to ¡°universal¡± background checks ? requiring checks for all sales ? but still falls short of a nationwide mandate, which the Biden Administration wants to see implemented by Congress. The incremental gun control rule is also well short of the overhaul Biden has called for including banning assault weapons which faces stiff opposition on Capitol Hill. Biden's administration won a narrow victory at the Supreme Court this summer over its tougher regulation of unserialized or ""ghost guns."" The new rule would also clarify what a gun shop should do with its inventory after it goes out of business. It provides lawful ways to liquidate that inventory to other licensed shops rather than hosting a ¡°fire sale¡± to regular purchasers without conducting background checks. More:After repeated ATF warnings, gun dealers can count on the agency to back off; sometimes firearms flow to criminals It likewise sought to clarify that guns in a ¡°personal firearms collection¡± by a hobbyist or collector could be sold without fear of violating the law. Once the proposed rule is published in the Federal Register, the public will have 90 days to submit comments. The notice of proposed rulemaking submitted by the Department can be viewed here.

Biden was set to plead guilty in July to two misdemeanor charges for not filing taxes in 2017 and 2018, which he has since paid. He was also set to enter a pretrial program for a gun charge, which would have resulted in the charge being dropped if he complied with program¡¯s requirements. But U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika refused to accept the plea agreement because of disputes between Biden¡¯s lawyers and federal prosecutors about the terms. Congressional Republicans called the agreement a ¡°sweetheart deal.¡± Republicans called for an independent prosecutor to replace David Weiss, the U.S. attorney for Delaware, who had investigated Biden for five years and reached the plea deal. Instead, Attorney General Merrick appointed Weiss a special counsel with broader powers to continue his investigation. The indictment deadline resulted from the collapse of the plea deal. Under the federal Speedy Trial Act, the clock for a prosecution continued to tick once charges were filed against Biden, so prosecutors need to act or drop the case. ¡°The Speedy Trial Act excludes, ¡®delay reasonably attributable to any period, not to exceed thirty days, during which any proceeding concerning the defendant is actually under advisement by the court,¡¯¡± prosecutors said. In a filing Wednesday, prosecutors said ¡°the government intends to seek the return of an indictment in this case¡± before Sept. 29. The filing came in the court docket for the previous gun charge rather than the tax charges. Biden¡¯s lawyer, Abbe Lowell, also filed an update saying he has complied with conditions for his pretrial release. Three House Republican chairmen sent a letter Wednesday to Biden¡¯s lawyers, Christopher Clark and Lowell, asking for documents related to the plea deal. Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio, head of the Judiciary Committee; James Comer of Kentucky, head of the Oversight and Accountability Committee; and Jason Smith of Missouri, head of the Ways and Means Committee, seeks documents described in articles in the New York Times and Politico about how the deal fell apart. The lawmakers alleged it was ¡°highly likely¡± the documents came from Biden¡¯s defense team. Lawmakers asked for the 32-page letter from Clark to Weiss about the potential gun charge, the 100-slide PowerPoint presentation about tax charges and other emails. Lowell called the request further evidence of interfering with the investigation. ¡°These Republican chairmen continue to abuse their power to push a purely partisan attack on the Biden administration and family,"" Lowell said. "" This latest demand is further proof of their continued and improper interference with the Justice Department¡¯s investigation, which remains ongoing and in which Congress has no legitimate role.¡± Prosecutors said Hunter Biden took in $2.4 million in income in 2017 and $2.1 in 2018 through Ukrainian energy firm Burisma, a Chinese-development firm, as well as domestic business interests and legal services. Leo Wise, an assistant U.S. attorney, said an accountant prepared Biden's taxes both of those years, but his corporate and personal taxes were not paid. During this period, Hunter Biden made large cash withdrawals and covered other expenses like car payments on a Porsche, Wise said. Biden told the court a ""third party"" paid the back taxes along with interest and fees pursuant to a personal loan he has not begun to repay. Another charge in Weiss's inquiry alleges Biden made a false statement on a federal form when he bought a gun in 2018. The?Gun Control Act prohibits drug users from possessing firearms. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives ruled the ban applies to?""a conviction for use or possession of a controlled substance within the past year."" Biden filled out a federal form when he bought a handgun in October 2018 in which he replied ¡°no¡± to a question of whether he was ¡°an unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any depressant, stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance,""?according to the Washington Post. By his own account in his memoir ¡°Beautiful Things,¡±?Biden battled drug addiction and for periods during 2018 smoked crack ¡°every 15 minutes.¡±",USA

These are the seats up for re-election.,"Corrections & Clarifications: The story has been updated to correct David Trone's time of service as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives.? The 2024 presidential campaign is already well underway, but ballots across the country are long, and commander in chief isn't the only position in play. There are 33 United States senators up for re-election in 2024. Ten are Republicans, three are Independents, and 20 are Democrats. The upper chamber, which is now controlled narrowly by Democrats, could flip red if the GOP performs well next November. The map is considered to favor Republicans slightly this election cycle, though electoral predictions will continue to evolve, and surprises on the campaign trail are always possible. Come decision day 2024, these are the states that will see contests for senator, and who currently represents them. Party: Independent Sinema, once a Democrat, is known for her eccentric fashion choices and her centrist views, which have regularly held up the Democratic policy agenda. Sinema, who left the Democratic Party in December 2022, citing concerns over ""rigid partisanship,"" will be challenged from the left by current Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz. Party: Democratic Feinstein is a veteran of the Senate whose age has come into play as a prominent political concern. Earlier this year she was absent from the chamber for over two months, recovering from a case of shingles. Her absence brought important committee votes to a standstill and led some to call for her resignation. She will not seek another term, and the race for her seat is expected to be highly competitive with heavy hitters from the Democratic Party, such as Democratic Reps. Barbara Lee, Adam Schiff and Katie Porter vying for her spot. Party: Democratic Murphy has served as the senator from Connecticut since 2013 and is expected to cruise to re-election in 2024 in predominantly blue Connecticut. During his time in the chamber, he has made gun control a major issue, often referencing the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting in his home state. Party: Democratic Carper, who originally won his seat in 2000, will not seek another term. In his retirement announcement, Carper endorsed Rep.?Lisa Blunt Rochester?to be his successor. Blunt Rochester formally announced her candidacy in June. Party: Republican Scott has been a senator since 2019, and he served as state governor before his time in the upper chamber. Scott is a vocal supporter of former President Donald Trump and was tasked as chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee?with securing a victory for the party in the midterms. Party: Democratic Hirono was the first Asian American woman to be elected a U.S. senator. She first won her seat in 2012 and has spent much of her tenure in the chamber working on legislation addressing immigration, the environment and veterans affairs. Party: Republican Braun, who won his Senate seat in 2018, is opting to run for governor in his state rather than seek a second term. Braun is not the only Republican seeking the governorship. Among others, he will have to run against Lt. Gov. Suzanne Crouch. The race to replace Braun is expected to become crowded, with plenty of rising GOP stars hoping to toss their hat in the ring. Party: Independent King has not yet announced his 2024 reelection bid but appears to be gearing up for another run. One of just three independents in the Senate, he has held the seat since 2013. Party: Democratic Cardin, who has been in office since 2007, announced in May he would not seek re-election. Since the announcement, a slew of candidates have indicated they plan to run in the Democratic primary in Maryland, including Prince George's County Executive Angela Alsobrooks, U.S. Rep. David Trone and Montgomery County Councilmember Will Jawando. Party: Democratic One-time presidential hopeful and Senate veteran Elizabeth Warren is running to keep her seat in 2024. She has served as senator for ten years and is unlikely to face a strong primary challenger. Party: Democratic Stabenow, who has been in the Senate since 2001, announced plans to retire in early January, opening up a seat in a critical battleground state. In the Democratic primary to replace her, Rep. Elissa Slotkin is widely considered the frontrunner, though former state Rep. Leslie Love and businessman Nasser Beydoun have also declared candidacies. On the Republican side, businessman Michael Hoover and State Board of Education member Nikki Snyder have announced plans to run. Party: Democratic Klobuchar, who rose to national fame during her 2020 bid for the presidency, has been a Minnesota senator since 2007 and is the first woman to be elected by the state to the Senate. Party: Republican Wicker has been the state's senator since 2007 and will run again in 2024. He serves as the ranking member on the Senate Armed Services Committee. Party: Republican Famous in part for holding up a fist in support of rioters outside the capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, Hawley forms part of a growing conservative flank of the GOP. He will run for re-election in 2024 and be challenged on the left by both St. Louis County Prosecutor Wesley Bell and Maine Corps veteran Lucas Kunce. Party: Democratic A Democrat in a deeply red state, Tester has held his Senate seat since 2007. He is expected to face a tough challenge from the right in 2024 as Republicans battle to regain a majority in the U.S. Senate. Among the names being floated as potential challengers are U.S. Rep. Matthew M. Rosendale, who lost to Tester in 2018, and Tim Sheehy, a businessman and veteran. Party: Republican Fischer has represented Nebraska in the Senate since the 2012 midterms and has already announced her plans to seek reelection. The move makes it less likely for another Republican to throw their hat in the ring, though some speculated Republican Gov. Pete Ricketts?was weighing a run. Party: Democratic Rosen, who has already announced her reelection bid for 2024, has held her seat since 2019. Nevada is a fiercely divided state and forms part of a challenging electoral map for Democrats. Though no Republicans have yet announced their candidacy, Rosen is expected to have to defend her seat from a strong challenger. Party: Democratic Menendez has held his Senate seat since 2006 and intends to run again but is facing, along with his wife, a broad federal investigation centered in part on undisclosed gifts the senator received, the Washington Post reported. Party: Democratic Heinrich, who has held his seat since 2013, will run again in 2024. He launched his campaign for a third term with a video touching on gun safety and the importance of a transition to clean energy. Republicans have not yet announced a challenger. Party: Democratic Gillibrand has become a mainstay of New York politics, holding her Senate seat since 2009. This primary season she will face a challenge from Army veteran William Schweitzer, who once worked in Sen. Chuck Schumer¡¯s Rochester district office and served as deputy press secretary during ex-Gov. Andrew Cuomo¡¯s 2018 reelection campaign. Though speculation swirled over whether Gillibrand would face more challenges from up-and-coming New York lawmakers, no other candidates have yet been announced. Party: Republican Cramer, who won his seat in 2018, has not yet announced plans to seek reelection. Cramer was a close ally of Trump during the former president's term in office, but has since voiced support for a possible replacement on the 2024 GOP ticket. Party: Democratic Brown is a prominent target for Republicans in 2024. He occupies a swing state seat they see as a possible pick-up in their quest to regain control of the chamber. An ad blitz has already begun in the state as GOP challengers attempt to oust Brown, who first won the election in 2006. Republican state Sen. Matt Dolan has already announced a run along with businessman Bernie Moreno, and GOP Secretary of State Frank LaRose?is also rumored to be considering a run. Party: Democratic Casey was first elected in 2006. Though he represents a swing state identified by Republicans as an ideal win in 2024, he is considered a tough candidate to beat. The son of former Gov. Robert Casey, Sr.?he is widely popular in the state, especially with swaths of voters other Democrats have begun to struggle with attracting. The GOP is expected to run former business executive David McCormick, though he has not yet announced. Party: Democratic Whitehouse, who has been in the Senate for a little under a decade, is running for a fourth term. He will face a challenge on the right from Raymond McKay, a veteran and former president of the Rhode Island Republican Assembly. Party: Republican Elected in 2018, Blackburn has become a prominent voice among conservatives, particularly on culture war issues. She has announced plans to seek reelection, but will face a prominent challenge on the left. State Rep. Gloria Johnson, who entered the national spotlight when she was nearly expelled from the state legislature for holding a protest on the House floor against gun violence, will run. Two of her colleagues, Democratic Reps. Justin Jones of Nashville and Justin Pearson of Memphis were briefly expelled for the same action. Joining her in the primary is Marquita Bradshaw, an activist for environmental justice who mounted an unsuccessful bid for Senate in 2020. Nashville attorney Joanne Sowell, another Democrat, has already filed her candidacy with the FEC. Party: Republican Cruz, a political firebrand for his party and a two-time presidential candidate, successfully battled off a challenge from Democratic candidate Beto O'Rourke in 2018. For 2024, he may have to do the same. Democratic Rep. Colin Allred, and state Sen. Roland Gutierrez, are both running for the with hopes of unseating Cruz. Party: Republican One-time presidential nominee for the GOP, Romney has come to occupy a minority in recent years, treading a more centrist, anti-Trump line. He has held his Senate seat since 2019, serving before that as Governor of Massachusetts. Party: Independent Sanders, a famously outspoken member of the Senate's left flank, has been in office since 2007. He is one of the chamber's few independents but often votes on a party line with Democrats. Sanders, who famously energized a grass-roots movement during his 2016 and 2020 presidential runs, has ruled out a 2024 bid, saying instead he would endorse Biden. Party: Democratic Kaine, who was the vice presidential candidate on Hillary Clinton's ticket in 2016, has represented Virginia in the Senate since 2013. For Democrats who face a tough electoral map in 2024, his race is a must-win. Though Kaine is a veteran of Virginia politics, and the state tends to lean blue, Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin's win in 2021 proved a red tilt is not far off. Eddie Garcia, a military veteran, has already announced he will seek the GOP nomination in the Senate race. Party: Democratic Cantwell has been in the Senate for over two decades, first winning election in 2000. Cantwell has yet to announce plans to seek re-election but is expected to. No GOP candidates have thrown their hats in the ring so far. Party: Democratic Manchin, a notoriously centrist vote on the Democratic side, has not yet announced a 2024 re-election bid. Rumors have swirled that the West Virginia political titan is weighing a possible third-party run for president. Potential presidential bid aside, Manchin is one of his party's most vulnerable incumbents. The GOP primary in West Virginia is already shaping up with Gov. Jim Justice, a former Democrat who swapped parties in 2017, jumping in the race on the establishment side, and Rep. Alex Mooney, who belongs to the hyper-conservative House Freedom Caucus running, to his right. Party: Democratic Baldwin, who announced plans for re-election in April, is a prime target for the GOP this election cycle. Though no Republican has yet formally announced their candidacy, behind the scenes plenty of names are being floated. ""I don¡¯t think anybody¡¯s fairly concerned about the timing yet,"" Mark Jefferson, executive director of the Republican Party of Wisconsin, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, part of the USA TODAY network ""And we have some strong candidates looking at it.¡± Party: Republican Barrasso has represented Wyoming in the Senate since 2007. In one of the reddest states in the country, he has not yet formally announced his candidacy but is unlikely to face a strong Democratic challenger.",USA
https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2023/09/11/more-school-districts-are-bringing-back-or-adding-school-resource-officers/70731118007/,2023-09-11,More school districts are bringing back or adding police. Experts say it may not help,"In 2021, the year after racial justice protests began spreading across the country, the District of Columbia City Council voted to gradually phase out school resource officers by 2025. But this May, council members voted to repeal that plan after pushback from Mayor Muriel Bowser, who said in a statement last year that school leaders overwhelmingly opposed removing school resource officers because of fights on campus and concerns about student well-being. Washington is one of several communities that have decided to reverse plans to remove school resource officers or increase their numbers as students return to classrooms this fall amid an increase in gunfire in schools. Law enforcement officials say their presence in schools has been complicated by staffing shortages and new restrictions, while experts say research shows there's little evidence it will increase school safety and may in fact harm students of color. D.C. Council member Robert White, who supports removing and replacing police officers in schools but voted to repeal the plan to phase them out, said violence in schools has not ended because of the presence of police in schools. Still, he noted, many educators are worried about violence in their communities, want their students to be safe and see officers as ""the closest city personnel to achieve the goals that they are trying to meet."" ""I can be an ideologue and say 'No, I'm just going to oppose school resource officers, despite testimonies of teachers,'"" White told USA TODAY. ""But what that's going to end up with is permanent school resource officers. If we want to replace them, we have to create the new mechanism and get to there so teachers are comfortable."" Research:Is more school police the answer after Uvalde shooting? Days after George Floyd was murdered in Minneapolis in 2020, the city's school board unanimously voted to end the district's contract with the Minneapolis Police Department, prompting a wave of other districts across the country to follow suit. At least 50 districts went on to end school police programs or reduce the programs' budgets, Education Week reported last year. But by June 2022, at least eight districts in states including Virginia, California and New York had reversed course, Education Week found. This June, Denver joined that growing list when a split-decision school board vote reversed a 2020 policy prohibiting armed officers on school campuses, the Denver Post reported. The heated and emotional debate was connected to a shooting at a Denver high school earlier this year, according to Auon'tai Anderson, a school board member who voted against the reversal. Defund police in schools?How the movement got momentum after George Floyd's death Anderson said data showed the decision to remove officers had the intended effect of reducing the tickets and citations arrests, which disproportionately affect Black students. But he said there is no evidence to suggest the presence of a school officer could have prevented the shooting in March. ""This conversation to return SROs was not based in science or the fact that they prevented anything but based in fear,"" Anderson said. ""We believe this is the best preventable cure to stop mass shootings, which is just not true."" Nearly half of parents said they?fear for their child¡¯s safety at school, the highest percentage in nearly two decades, according to a 2022 Gallup poll. Although officers reduce some forms of violence, such as physical attacks and fights, they do not prevent gun-related incidents, according to a 2021 study from the RAND Corporation, a nonprofit think tank, and the University at Albany. ""The best evidence that we have to date shows no deterrent effect of where gun violence happens in schools or where weapons are brought to schools. ... Similarly, when a shooting does happen in a school, those shootings, actually, on average have been more deadly in schools with police,"" said Ben Fisher, a University of Wisconsin-Madison professor who recently reviewed dozens of studies on the effects of police in schools. This question gained national attention this year during the trial of a former school resource officer?who did not confront the gunman during the deadly 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, and the investigation into the failures of law enforcement when a shooter killed?19 children and two adults at an elementary school last year in Uvalde, Texas. ""There is this idea, especially in our country, that the police are going to be the ones to solve a variety of social problems. That includes school violence,"" Fisher said. Lawmakers in some states have also passed and proposed legislation to increase police presence in schools. In Kentucky and Texas, new laws require all schools to have school resource officers. In Tennessee, where a shooter killed six people at a Nashville elementary school in March, a lawmaker recently proposed legislation to allow police to assign officers to work at schools, even if the school board doesn't have a policy or agreement with the department. But as the demand for school resource officers appears to have increased, staffing has been a challenge, according to Mo Canady, executive director of the National Association of School Resource Officers.? ""We are in a huge law enforcement recruiting crisis across the country, not just for SROs but for law enforcement officers in general,"" Canady said. ""So you know, while we certainly want to see more selected and specifically trained SROs in the school environment, finding them is now becoming problematic."" The Nashville Metropolitan Police Department faced backlash last month for deciding to forego millions in new state funding for school resource officers?because the agency cannot staff the area's 70 public elementary schools, reported The Tennessean, part of the USA TODAY Network. Texas gave districts about $15,000 per campus in additional funding as part of a new law requiring school resource officers, which took effect Sept. 1. But Dan Turner, chief of Alief Independent School District Police Department, said that money ""is basically not enough to do anything with when it comes to hiring a police officer."" Turner said the school district, which is based in southwest Houston, has approved additional funding to cover the cost of hiring about 30 officers to cover all of the district's elementary schools. Li Wen Su, a spokesperson for?the district, said the?additional positions approved to meet the new requirements have an estimated cost of $2 million. Turner said actually finding officers to hire has been the biggest challenge. ""We're in competition with all the districts in Texas,"" he said. The law allows exceptions, but it's unclear how many schools weren't able to meet the standard because districts are not required to report if they meet the state¡¯s new requirements of having armed officers on every campus. The Associated Press reported at least half of 60 of Texas¡¯ largest school districts were unable to meet the law¡¯s highest standard at the start of the school year. Jeff Potts, executive director of the Minnesota Chiefs of Police Association, said parents and school districts have become more receptive to having officers in schools because of ""the threat of violence."" But he said law enforcement agencies removed officers from dozens of schools before the start of the school year as a result of a new state law. The law prohibits officers from physically restraining students in certain ways, including face down in the ""prone position,"" and allows them to use reasonable force to restrain a student ""to prevent imminent bodily harm or death."" Potts said the law has officers concerned that they or their department could face criminal or civil repercussions if they act too soon to prevent a conflict from escalating or that students could be harmed if they wait too long to intervene. Potts has asked the governor to intervene and provide a legislative solution. ""Our hope is to get back to a place here very quickly through a special session that the SROs will go back, because I think they'll be welcomed with open arms,"" he said. ""It's just right now we're in this kind of awkward period where the new law has really changed that."" Aaron Kupchik, a professor of sociology and criminal justice at the University of Delaware, said adding officers in schools probably will bring ""unintended negative consequences."" The RAND and University of Albany study also found school resource officers increase the use of student suspensions, expulsions, police referrals and arrests, punishments that disproportionally affect Black students, male students and students with disabilities. Kupchik said that while suspension or arrest may sometimes be necessary, these solutions are used too frequently, which causes harm to some students and school communities. Canady said school resource officers should be dealing with ""disruptions that lead to criminal activity,"" not discipline problems that should be handled by the school. He said specific training related to implicit bias, working with children and adolescent mental health along with the relationships formed with students can help prevent negative interactions. ""Most SROs refer to the student body as 'my kids,'"" Canady said. ""And at that point, it doesn't matter. Culture, ethnicity and nationality, those things are out the window once you begin to approach it in that way."" Though the relationship building touted by many school resource officers sounds positive, Fisher, the University of Wisconsin-Madison professor, said these interactions aren't always beneficial to students. ""I remember one officer talking about how he essentially builds relationships with certain students because they funnel him information about problems that are going on in school,"" he said. ""So this isn't relationship building just for the sake of being a positive role model for students, but it's to help the officer solve crimes or catch the kids who are doing something that they've deemed inappropriate."" Kupchik said there are steps educators can take to preserve the school social climate, which is important for keeping schools safe. ""Act restoratively rather than suspending them or turning the behavior over to the police to do it. Things like that can be helpful,"" he said. ""These are solutions that we have had for literally decades, and they get put on the shelf because of the allure of suspending children and arresting them."" Contributing: The Associated Press",USA
https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/09/15/california-wants-constitution-raise-gun-buying-age/70861855007/,2023-09-15,California lawmakers want US Constitution to raise gun-buying age to 21. Could it happen?,"California lawmakers have approved a resolution proposed by Gov. Gavin Newsom calling for a convention to add an amendment to the U.S. Constitution related to gun control. In June, Newsom proposed a 28th Amendment, which would raise the minimum age to purchase a gun from 18 to 21, require universal background checks, institute a reasonable waiting period for all gun purchases, and bar civilians from purchasing assault weapons. Newsom's proposal, approved Thursday, faces a difficult road ahead. Amending the Constitution requires either two-thirds of state legislatures to call for a convention, also called an Article V Convention or amendatory convention, or a two-thirds majority vote in both houses of Congress, Thomas Donnelly, chief content officer at the National Constitution Center, previously told USA TODAY. None of the?27 amendments to the Constitution?have been proposed by a convention and the last time the Constitution was amended was in 1992, he said. If an amendment is proposed, three-fourths of the states must ratify it, Donnelly said. The resolution calls for ""a limited constitutional convention"" that would be used only to consider an amendment related to gun control. However, some California Democrats have expressed concern that it's not possible to limit a convention to just one issue. Republicans control more than half of state legislatures, and State Sen. Scott Wiener told the San Francisco Chronicle he worries a convention could lead to other amendments, such as measures that would restrict abortion access or LGBTQ+ rights. ¡°It¡¯s unclear whether there can be a convention limited to one topic,"" he told the outlet. ¡°We need to make sure that we¡¯re not going to inadvertently trigger a general constitutional convention because that could go real bad real fast."" Newsom has acknowledged how challenging the process would be but pledged to work with ""grassroots supporters, elected and civic leaders, and broad and diverse coalitions across the nation"" to get similar resolutions passed in the 33 other states required to convene the convention. ""California will be the first but that's just the beginning,"" Newsom said in a statement in June.",USA
https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/09/14/hunter-biden-indicted-on-federal-gun-charge/70853729007/,2023-09-15,Hunter Biden indicted on federal gun charges for allegedly lying about drug addiction,"Hunter Biden, the son of President Joe Biden, was indicted Thursday on federal gun charges less than two months after a plea agreement fell apart over tax and gun charges. The indictment charges Hunter Biden with knowingly deceiving a firearms dealer when buying a Colt Cobra 38SPL revolver on Oct. 12, 2018. He is charged with falsely filling out a federal firearms form denying he was addicted to any narcotics. And he is charged with knowingly possessing the revolver despite the restrictions against drug addicts owning firearms. Hunter Biden has acknowledged he was a drug addict at the time. The charges revive the prospect that Hunter Biden could be jailed if convicted and rekindle his role as a lightning rod for political criticism as his father runs for reelection in 2024. He faces a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison if convicted ? five years for the false statement to the dealer, 10 years for the false statement on the federal form and 10 years for possession of the firearm ? but actual sentences typically are shorter than the maximum, according to the Justice Department. Republicans had criticized the plea agreement, which could have carried no jail time, as a ""sweetheart deal"" and called for a new investigation. Instead, Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed David Weiss, the U.S. attorney for Delaware who had investigated Hunter Biden for five years before reaching the plea agreement, to be a special counsel to continue his investigation. Abbe Lowell, one of Hunter Biden's lawyers, dismissed the new charges as a reaction to political pressure. He said that after a five-year investigation, the evidence hadn't changed in the six weeks since prosecutors decided charges were not warranted. Lowell argued the charges are barred under the plea agreement and that the statute is unconstitutional. ¡°Hunter Biden possessing an unloaded gun for 11 days was not a threat to public safety, but a prosecutor, with all the power imaginable, bending to political pressure presents a grave threat to our system of justice,"" Lowell said. ""We believe these charges are barred by the agreement the prosecutors made with Mr. Biden, the recent rulings by several federal courts that this statute is unconstitutional, and the facts that he did not violate that law, and we plan to demonstrate?all of that in court.¡± Biden was set to plead guilty in July to?two misdemeanor charges for not paying his taxes?in 2017 and 2018, which he has since paid. He was also set to enter a pretrial program for a gun charge, which would have resulted in the charge being dropped if he complied with program¡¯s requirements. But U.S.?District Judge Maryellen Noreika refused to accept the plea?agreement because of disputes between Biden¡¯s lawyers and federal prosecutors about the terms. The?Gun Control Act prohibits drug users from possessing firearms. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives ruled the ban applies to?""a conviction for use or possession of a controlled substance within the past year."" When Biden filled out a federal form when he bought the handgun, he replied ¡°no¡± to a question of whether he was ¡°an unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any depressant, stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance."" By his own account in his memoir, ¡°Beautiful Things,¡±?Biden battled drug addiction and for periods during 2018 smoked crack ¡°every 15 minutes.¡± Prosecutors have wide discretion to defer prosecution or seek diversion programs and often do so in cases like Biden's in which the offender has no criminal record, the charges are minor and the case does not involve aggravating circumstances such as use of the firearm in a criminal act,?according to Cheryl Bader, a former federal prosecutor who runs the Criminal Defense Clinic at Fordham Law. Legal experts called the three charges harsh compared with the plea agreement, which could have potentially dismissed a single charge if Hunter Biden complied with the requirements. Harry Litman, a former U.S. attorney who is now a law professor at UCLA, said the Justice Department rarely brings such gun charges. ¡°The 3 false statement charges against Hunter Biden are a raw deal,¡± Litman said in a post on X, the site formerly known as Twitter. ¡°There appears to be nothing that happened since the plea deal unraveled (through no fault of Biden) other than Republican ignorant potshots.¡± Andrew Weissmann, a former federal prosecutor and general counsel at the FBI, called Weiss erratic for veering from a deferred prosecution to pursuing three ¡°legally and factually tenuous charges.¡± ¡°The new gun charges display the same lack of judgment,¡± Weissmann said in a post on X. ¡°Expect lots of defense challenges.¡± Three House Republican chairmen have sent a letter to Biden¡¯s lawyers, Christopher Clark and Abbe Lowell, asking for documents related to the plea deal. Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio, head of the Judiciary Committee; James Comer of Kentucky, head of the Oversight and Accountability Committee; and Jason Smith of Missouri, head of the Ways and Means Committee, seek documents described in articles in The New York Times and Politico about how the deal fell apart. ¡°The Justice Department¡¯s sweetheart deal fell apart after a federal judge refused to rubber-stamp it,¡± Comer said Thursday. Lowell has called the request further evidence of interfering with the investigation. ¡°These Republican chairmen continue to abuse their power to push a purely partisan attack on the Biden administration and family,"" Lowell said. "" This latest demand is further proof of their continued and improper interference with the Justice Department¡¯s investigation, which remains ongoing and in which Congress has no legitimate role.¡± Under the part of the plea agreement for not paying taxes, prosecutors said Hunter Biden took in $2.4 million in income in 2017 and $2.1 million in 2018 through Ukrainian energy firm Burisma, a Chinese development firm, as well as domestic business interests and legal services. Leo Wise, an assistant U.S. attorney, said an accountant prepared Biden's taxes both of those years, but his corporate and personal taxes were not paid. During this period, Hunter Biden made large cash withdrawals and covered other expenses like car payments on a Porsche, Wise said. Biden told the court a ""third party"" paid the back taxes along with interest and fees pursuant to a personal loan he had not begun to repay in July.",USA
https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2023/09/16/suicide-prevention-reframe-gun-control-debate/70834541007/,2023-09-16,Suicide leads gun-related deaths. Why don't we mention it when talking about gun control?,"This column contains discussion of suicide. If you or someone you know might be struggling with suicidal thoughts, you can call or text?the?988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline?at 988 or 1-800-273-8255, or chat online at?988lifeline.org For Republicans in Congress, the rise in deadly gun violence has so far been insufficient to trigger any sort of meaningful legislative action. The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act aside, our hyperpartisan politics have rendered even commonsense gun safety measures a?nonstarter?for this GOP.? While Republicans continue to delay, Americans continue to die, with suicide being the nation¡¯s?leading cause?of gun-related deaths. Since January,?nearly 17,000 have died by firearm suicide. After observing National Suicide Prevention Week, we ??one of us a leading advocate for gun violence reduction, the other a survivor of firearm suicide loss?? offer that reframing the gun control debate around suicide prevention can help build consensus for commonsense solutions and ultimately save lives. Firearm suicide touches all Americans, but it does not do so equally. According to?data?from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, white men die at the highest rate. White men are also the?most likely?to own a gun ? and?to vote Republican. Furthermore,?four of the top five states?with the highest rates of firearm suicide ? Wyoming, Montana, Alaska and Oklahoma ? are states with a Republican governor and dangerously loose gun laws. Those same states are in the?top seven for gun ownership rates. (The states with the lowest rates of gun ownership are blue states with stricter gun laws and some of the lowest rates of firearm suicide.) If Republicans in Congress were to recognize ? or admit ? the extent to which legislative inaction on guns is killing their voters and constituents, the only acceptable response would be to support commonsense gun control measures. What might some of those commonsense measures be? Red flag laws, on the books in?21 states, function by allowing a court to temporarily block an individual's access to firearms if a family member or law enforcement can prove that their mental state renders them a threat to themselves or others. Indiana's legislature passed red flag legislation?in 2005, and it was signed into law by Republican Gov. Mitch Daniels. In the decade following the law¡¯s enactment, the state experienced a?7.5% drop?in its gun suicide rate. How not to cover gun violence:Jacksonville shooting has already faded from memory. Victims deserve better from the media. A federal mandatory waiting period for firearms purchases would require that a certain amount of time elapse before someone who has purchased a gun can actually possess that gun. This commonsense policy could buy precious time for a suicidal individual to reconsider their decision or for loved ones to intervene. Mandatory waiting periods are already saving lives in?11 states? ? including in Florida, where in 2018 Gov. Rick Scott, also a Republican, signed a?three-day waiting period?into law. It¡¯s time that members of Congress afford all Americans these lifesaving protections.? Some opponents of reform argue that simply investing in?mental health?resources will solve this crisis. States should absolutely make mental health resources more widely available. It is interesting, though, that many of the same Republican leaders who insist that we focus on expanding mental health services simultaneously?oppose?the expansion of programs such as Medicaid, which could help pay for those services. We say it is a ¡°both/and¡± rather than an ¡°either/or.¡± Mental health resources are only beneficial if those who need help remain alive long enough to receive it. This means we must take reasonable steps to help protect those who wish to harm themselves. Treating mental health:Police shouldn't handle mental health calls. Reform is critical for public safety. Others might argue that making it more difficult to acquire a gun will simply lead suicidal individuals to seek out other means. Data suggests, however, that?reducing firearm suicide attempts would result in a significant reduction in overall suicides. This is likely because nearly 90% of firearm suicide attempts end in death while suicide attempts by other means are far less likely to end in fatalities. Enacting commonsense gun reform ? while yes, expanding access to mental health treatment ? would save lives. It is estimated that if every state had the same firearm suicide rates as those states with the strictest gun laws,?more than 70,000 lives?would have been saved over the past 20 years. Such facts should compel any rational and compassionate legislator to act. By focusing the conversation on suicide prevention, one cannot reasonably claim that gun violence only affects certain communities, or that it is an issue worthy of debate only when another mass shooting occurs. Americans of all backgrounds are dying every day from firearm suicide. The only way this changes is if Republican leaders show some courage and use their power to put people over politics.?

https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/05/01/new-york-gun-buyback-program/70171103007/,2023-05-01,Do gun buyback programs work? Thousands of firearms surrendered in New York in one day.,"People across New York state surrendered thousands of firearms in exchange for gift cards over the weekend in what the attorney general's office called a ""historic"" gun buyback event. The state hosted nine simultaneous gun buybacks on Saturday, yielding more than 3,000 guns, including 185 ""assault rifles,"" 1,656 handguns and 823 long guns, according to the office of New York Attorney General Letitia James. ""Gun violence has caused so many avoidable tragedies and robbed us of so many innocent New Yorkers,"" James said in a statement, calling every gun surrendered ""a potential tragedy averted."" Gun buyback programs in the U.S. have been around since the 1970s. They aim to reduce gun violence by compensating people who voluntarily turn over firearms to a public agency or private organization, typically at the county or city level, according to a review of the programs by the RAND Corporation in January. Guns turned in at buyback events are usually destroyed or reduced to raw materials and repurposed, according to the review. Sometimes law enforcement officers check the weapons to determine if they are associated with known crimes. There were an estimated 550 gun buybacks in 37 states between 1988 and 2021, according to research from three public health professionals cited in the review. During the 2020 presidential election cycle, multiple Democratic candidates expressed support for a mandatory government buyback of ""assault weapons."" President Joe Biden has previously expressed support for a voluntary federal buyback program. In New York, people were allowed to turn in as many weapons as they wished, with no questions asked and no ID required, according to the attorney general's office. Guns were required to be unloaded and placed in a plastic bag, paper bag or box, and they were allowed to be transported in the trunk of a vehicle. The program accepted ""assault weapons,"" handguns, rifles, shotguns, homemade or 3D-printed handguns, replicas and nonworking guns. Rewards started at $25, and ""assault rifles"" or ""ghost guns"" went for $500 each, according to the office. ""Assault weapons"" typically refer to semiautomatic firearms with military-style features that allow shooters to fire large numbers of rounds quickly. ""Ghost guns,"" also known as privately made firearms, are often assembled from kits purchased online or 3D-printed. They don't require the typical background checks for purchase and do not have serial numbers. What is an 'assault weapon'?With ban on AR-15s, Washington joins these states in prohibiting them. What is a ghost gun?A soaring number are being used in crimes. The attorney general's office did not immediately respond to request for comment on how many people participated in the buyback events or how much the state paid out. James has removed more than 7,000 guns from New York communities since taking office in 2019, according to her office. The New York City Police Department also has an anonymous buyback program called ""Cash for Guns,"" which offers $200 to anyone who surrenders a gun. While gun buyback programs are popular, there is little evidence to show they're effective in measurably reducing gun violence, even if they do prevent some incidents, the RAND review found. The programs are cheap, easy to implement and less politically divisive than policy change, the review noted. They also give officials something to point to as a tangible action on a major issue. But only a small fraction of firearms in a community are surrendered at these events, the review found. There is some evidence to suggest that national firearm bans and mandatory buybacks led to reductions in gun violence in other countries, the review found. Australia, Brazil, New Zealand and the U.K. previously passed mandatory buybacks in conjunction with new restrictions. But it's unclear if the same would be true in the U.S., where there are many more firearms, according to the review. While the buybacks likely have relatively little effect on homicide rates, they may have some effect on gun accidents and gun suicides, said David Hemenway, director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center. ""An important outcome of the buyback is having people work together, making it more likely they will work together on other aspects of the problem,"" he said.

I'm Taylor Wilson, and this is 5 Things you need to know Monday, the 8th of May 2023. Today, a violent weekend in Texas. Plus, the latest from the debt ceiling fight and driverless cars are here. Before I get into the meat of the stories today, a warning, this is a tough start to the week with some heavy topics. We start in Texas. Eight people were killed and others injured when an SUV slammed into a crowd at a city bus stop near a migrant shelter in Brownsville, Texas. Police said yesterday that the Sunday morning crash was still under investigation. Brownsville police investigator Martin Sandoval, told valleycentral.com that the driver was arrested on a charge of reckless driving and that more charges will likely be filed. The local media outlet said the crash happened in front of the Ozanam Center, a shelter for migrants and homeless people across the street from the bus stop. The male driver was the only person in the SUV and was hospitalized for injuries, according to police. Also, on Sunday, a gunman opened fire killing eight victims at an outlet mall in Allen, Texas outside Dallas. The attack is the latest in a string of mass shootings both nationwide and in Texas. Just a week ago, a gunman opened fire on neighbors in Cleveland, Texas, including a nine-year-old child. The state's governor, Greg Abbott, dismissed gun control legislation as a quick solution. He told Fox News Sunday that addressing mental health issues is the long-term solution. President Joe Biden tweeted that the gunman was armed with an AR15 style rifle. He once again called on Congress to pass a ban on assault weapons and high capacity magazines. ??Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen yesterday warned against President Joe Biden invoking the 14th amendment to end the debt limit fight. She told ABC's This Week that such a move could lead to a constitutional crisis, and she reiterated that Congress is the only authority able to raise the debt ceiling. Section IV of the 14th Amendment states that the ""validity of the public debt of the United States shall not be questioned."" Some say that language allows the President to raise the debt ceiling on his own, but Congress has always voted to raise the debt limit. And it's not clear how alternative options like invoking the 14th would play out. Yellen previously said the government could run out of cash to pay its bills by June 1st. Talks on raising the debt ceiling between Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy have stalled since their last meeting in February, but Biden is expected to meet with congressional leaders from both parties tomorrow. ??At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, Congress created emergency legislation that allowed participants of the supplemental nutrition assistance program also known as SNAP to receive the maximum monthly benefit regardless of income. That was done to address rising food insecurity and to give an economic stimulus. But those extra benefits ended at the end of February. And now with the debt ceiling crisis looming, GOP lawmakers are suggesting even more changes to the program. To get a better understanding of what those changes would mean to those on the program, I sat down with USA TODAY Politics Reporter Sarah Elbeshbishi. Sarah, thanks for hopping on the show. Sarah Elbeshbishi:Thanks for having me. Taylor Wilson:So House Republicans are proposing a plan that would include cuts to the SNAP program. What are these cuts specifically? Sarah Elbeshbishi:So in the recent bill that House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has brought forward for the debt stealing negotiations, it includes about $4.5 trillion in spending cuts, including raising the age limit for SNAP work requirements. So essentially right now, work requirements for people who don't have dependents under the age of 18 in their household are required to work a minimum of 80 hours a month, 20 hours a week in order to qualify for SNAP. If they don't meet that work requirement, they're only allowed up to three months of benefits for every three years. So currently that's 18 to 49 year olds. The proposed age requirement increases that to 55 that would affect nearly one million Americans between the age of 50 and 55. Taylor Wilson:Wow. A lot of people. So Sarah, these pandemic era supplemental benefits, as you mentioned, have already expired. How are the families that you spoke with who had relied on them for years during COVID dealing with these expirations already? Sarah Elbeshbishi:Yeah, it's definitely taken a toll. Parents Together Action, a nonprofit parent and family advocacy group, shared with USA TODAY a recent survey that they did of the parents and families that they work with about their experience just one month without those added benefits. And 63% of those parents said that they were having a hard time making ends meet, with 68% of them saying that having food on the table was their biggest challenge. And actually I spoke to a single mother from New Jersey who was saying that she had nothing in her fridge and she was trying to make the last $19 in her food stamps last so that she could feed her family of four. Taylor Wilson:Sarah, you wrote about another GOP sponsored bill that hasn't been voted on but would also impact SNAP recipients. Who is sponsoring that and how would that impact the program? Sarah Elbeshbishi:Yeah, so nearly two dozen House Republicans co-sponsored this legislation back in March, and this was led by South Dakota Rep. Dusty Johnson. It would also narrow the work requirement, raise the age from 49 to 65, which is even more of a drastic increase than McCarthy's proposed age increase. But it also would narrow the work requirement exemptions. Those who have dependents in their households under the age of 18 are exempt from that work requirement. Under this proposed bill by Johnson it would limit that exemption to only households with those under the age of seven instead of under the age of 18. And so if that were to be passed, more than 10 million people, about one in four SNAP participants, would be at risk of losing food assistance under the SNAP program. Taylor Wilson:?All right, Sarah Elbeshbishi covers congress, campaigns and democracy for USA TODAY. Thanks so much. Sarah Elbeshbishi:Thank you for having me. ??Taylor Wilson:?The Biden administration will take the first step today toward potentially requiring airlines to offer compensation beyond refunds for controllable flight cancellations or significant delays. President Joe Biden and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg will announce that the government will begin the process to examine whether airlines must also cover expenses for meals, lodging, and rebooking when airlines are responsible for stranding passengers. The 10 largest airlines do guarantee meals and free rebooking on the same airline while nine guarantee hotel accommodations. Virtually no airlines offer compensation on top of refunds or amenities, according to the White House. For now, consumers can always check the government site flightrights.gov to see what airlines currently offer. ??Driverless cars. It once seemed like a concept in the distant future. But in some parts of America that future is here, for better and for worse. USA TODAY National Correspondent Elizabeth Weiss explains. Hello, Beth. Elizabeth Weiss:Hey, how are you? Taylor Wilson:Good, thanks. Thanks for hopping back on the podcast. Elizabeth Weiss:Always happy to be here. Taylor Wilson:So I want to just start here. How common are self-driving cars in America right now? Elizabeth Weiss:Pretty uncommon in America, pretty common in certain cities. Mostly at this point, San Francisco and Phoenix, which are two big test beds. And the two biggest companies that are out there right now are Waymo, which is a Google offshoot, and then Cruise, which is actually owned by General Motors. There's something like 56 companies, they've done some of the regulatory work to at least start testing self-driving cars, but the number of companies that are actually doing it at scale is quite small. I think in San Francisco or in California, there were three. Taylor Wilson:And so before we get to some of the criticisms and annoyances with these cars, what solutions can they offer? Elizabeth Weiss:What the solutions are really depends upon who you talk to. There is a utopian vision 30 years out when we have a small fleet of electric self-driving vehicles that you kind of summon at need. If there's a group who needs to go from point A to point B, the system could figure that out and get them all in the same car or the same van and it would lower the number of actual miles driven. So that's kind of this utopian hope. Whether that would actually come to pass is unknown. There was an MIT study that was done just a bit ago that actually found that people might drive more the easier you make it. And actually there was a fascinating study that the University of California Davis did where they offered people chauffeured driving, which is effectively what a self-driving car is, it's a chauffeured car without the chauffeur. And people drove 25% more miles because it was so easy. I mean, overall, you want to lower the number of individual vehicle miles driven and will self-driving cars do that? I think at this point we don't know. Taylor Wilson:And what are some of the major criticisms of this technology right now? Elizabeth Weiss:Boy, they freak people out. And how people feel about them. It ranges from bemused to annoyed to angry, to, oh my God, it's the robot apocalypse and this is Skynet, and we're in the Terminator movie suddenly. And it kind of depends. I mean, so they are everywhere in San Francisco. San Francisco's a small town, seven by seven miles, and there are about three hundred Cruise cars in San Francisco. And I don't have a number yet on how many Waymo's there are, but there's a lot in my neighborhood specifically. And I can't tell you how many times I'm out, and there's a fair number of people on the streets in San Francisco, and I'll be at a crosswalk with somebody and the person next to me, they look and they're like, ""Wait a minute, there's nobody in that car."" And you're like, ""Yeah."" They're like, ""Whoa."" You just hear a lot of ""Whoa."" And that's the bemused as opposed to the, ""Dammit, they have blocked the school bus, they blocked the firetruck."" I mean, there's a lot of that. Taylor Wilson:Are cities fighting back against this elsewhere in America, or will they soon embrace them with open arms? Elizabeth Weiss:I don't know if they'll embrace them with open arms. There's work afloat to test them in parts of LA, Boston. All these companies, everybody imagines that this is the future. We will be being driven by our cars rather than driving them. And there are two arguments for that. There's the safety argument that is often made, which is that eventually, and perhaps already, these cars are safer than human drivers. There's this other dream that somehow it will lower carbon emissions. And I feel like the jury's still out on that one a little more. I don't think anybody quite knows when it's going to happen but when we see these technological advances, it does seem that they often take root. So, in 10 years it's going to be really interesting to see is this one that took root or did it become the Betamax and fall away. Taylor Wilson:All right, Elizabeth Weiss, great insight as always. Thanks so much. Elizabeth Weiss:You are so welcome. Taylor Wilson:Thanks for listening to 5 Things. You can find us every day of the week right here, wherever you get your audio.

Filed prior to the deadly shooting at The Covenant School in Nashville, Lee, a Republican, pushed for additional funding and new security protocols and mental health resources following the tragedy. ¡°Nothing is more important than Tennessee students and teachers returning home from school safely each day,¡± Lee said in a statement Wednesday. ¡°Every year since 2019, we¡¯ve worked with the General Assembly to prioritize school safety, and this year, we¡¯ve passed significant measures to fund an armed SRO for every public school, enhance mental health support and boost physical security at public and private schools across Tennessee.¡± Approved by both the House and Senate in April, the new law allocates $230 million for enhanced safety, including $30 million to place school resource officers in every public school, $54 million toward security upgrades for public and private schools, $140 million to place Homeland Security agents in every county to coordinate school security responses, and $8 million to provide new school-based behavioral help staff.? It also prescribes new safety protocols for both public and private schools, requiring emergency drills and increasing security collaboration with state and local law enforcement. The bill does not restrict access to firearms. ¡°Hardening security at our public and private schools is no longer just a priority, it is an imperative,¡± Lt. Gov. Randy McNally, R-Oak Ridge, said in a statement. ¡°The safety of our schools is of paramount importance and I am grateful we were in the financial position to quickly allocate the funds for these improvements.¡± The new law, which takes effect Wednesday, requires every public school to:? It requires private schools to:? It requires school districts to:? Democrats have criticized the measure for not adding any new restrictions on guns, arguing that it does nothing to keep ""weapons of war"" out of the hands of people who would do harm. The bill passed the House without support from three Democrats who faced expulsion from the chamber after interrupting House proceedings by protesting for gun control. ¡°We don¡¯t want gun battles at our schoolhouse door,"" Rep. Gloria Johnson, D-Knoxville said during the House floor debate. House Speaker Cameron Sexton, R-Crossville, in a statement praised the new security measures and acknowledged that there is more work to do. ¡°We will continue speaking with members and Tennesseans about further improvements to school safety, additional resources to improve mental health outcomes, and the best ways forward to keep our children and schools safe,¡± Sexton said.

A federal judge in Virginia has ruled that a law banning licensed federal firearms dealers from selling handguns to young adults under 21 violates the Second Amendment and is unconstitutional. The ruling Wednesday by U.S. District Court Judge Robert Payne in Richmond, if not overturned, would prevent dealers from selling handguns to 18- to 20-year-olds. In his 71-page ruling, Payne wrote that many of the rights and responsibilities of citizenship are granted at the age of 18, including the right to vote, enlist in the military without parental permission and serve on a federal jury. ""If the Court were to exclude 18-to-20-year-olds from the Second Amendment's protection, it would impose limitations on the Second Amendment that do not exist with other constitutional guarantees,"" Payne wrote. ""Because the statutes and regulations in question are not consistent with our Nation's history and tradition, they, therefore, cannot stand."" TEXAS GUN BILL:¡®Raise the age¡¯ gun bill passes Texas committee after months of advocacy by Uvalde families 3D PRINTED MACHINE GUNS:A Mississippi man used a 3D printer to make machine guns. Now he's going to prison for 14 years. Payne's ruling is the latest decision striking down gun laws in the wake of a landmark Supreme Court ruling last year that changed the test courts have long used to evaluate challenges to firearm restrictions. The Supreme Court said judges should no longer consider whether the law serves public interests, like enhancing public safety. Governments that want to uphold a gun restriction must look back into history to show it is consistent with the country's ""historical tradition of firearm regulation,"" the Supreme Court said. Amid upheaval in the months since that ruling, courts have declared unconstitutional laws including federal measures designed to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers and defendants under felony indictment, as well as a ban on possessing guns with the serial number removed. A federal judge recently cited the high court decision in ruling against a Minnesota law prohibiting 18- to 20-year-olds from getting permits to carry handguns in public. A judge struck down a similar law last year on gun restrictions for young adults in Texas. Payne, who cited the 2022 Supreme Court ruling repeatedly in his ruling, wrote that the government failed to present ""any evidence of age-based restrictions on the purchase or sale of firearms from the colonial era, Founding or Early Republic."" The lack of similar regulations from those time periods indicates that the ""Founders considered age-based regulations on the purchase of firearms to circumscribe the right to keep and bear arms confirmed by the Second Amendment,"" he wrote. John Corey Fraser, 20, along with several other plaintiffs, challenged the constitutionality of the Gun Control Act of 1968 and the associated regulations from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives after they were turned down when they tried to buy handguns. ""Even though it ensures that future buyers can now purchase these firearms in the federal system ? one that includes background checks and other requirements ? we expect the defendants will appeal,"" said Elliott Harding, Fraser's attorney. He said he is optimistic that the ruling will be affirmed. CHICAGO GUN VIOLENCE:Gun violence statistics reveal 'startling' truths about racial disparities in Chicago Harding said the lawsuit was aimed at ""closing a loophole"" because 18- to 20-year-olds can already buy handguns from private sellers, a process that is ""completely unregulated."" ""This allows them to go in and buy a registered firearm, direct from a manufacturer, but they'll also go through background checks,"" he said. ""They have to go through the traditional steps in purchasing a firearm."" Everytown Law, a legal group that advocates for gun violence prevention in the courts and has filed a brief supporting the age restrictions, said the law is constitutional and an essential tool for preventing gun violence. ""Not only are guns the leading cause of death for U.S. kids and teens, but research shows us that 18- to 20-year-olds commit gun homicides at triple the rate of adults 21 years and older,"" said Janet Carter, Everytown Law's senior director of issues and appeals. ""The Court's ruling will undoubtedly put lives at risk,"" she said. ""It must be reversed."" The Justice Department and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives did not respond to emails seeking comment on the ruling.",USA

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer signed a series of bills into law Monday that will keep firearms away from people who pose an imminent threat in the wake of the recent Michigan State University mass shooting that left three students dead and five others injured. The legislation follows Democratic lawmakers' call for more gun restrictions in an attempt to reduce gun violence across the state. With Whitmer's signature on Senate Bill 83, Michigan joins a list of more than a dozen states with so-called ""red flag"" laws, also sometimes called ""extreme risk protection orders."" Michigan is the second state to implement a red flag law in less than a week, following Minnesota. New Mexico was previously the last state to pass a red flag law, in 2020. Michigan's legislation won't go into effect immediately because it did not garner any Republican support in the state Legislature. Instead, the law is slated to take effect 90 days after the end of the legislative session. It will allow law enforcement, family members, health care professionals and others to petition a judge to remove firearms from those they believe are a risk to themselves or others. Whitmer said the legislation would help curb gun violence, including firearm suicides and mass shootings. Many perpetrators of gun violence show ""warning signs,"" Whitmer said. And now law enforcement and courts have a tool to intervene, she said. ""We must act because week after week in America we see grim, familiar headlines,"" Whitmer said at a bill signing ceremony flanked by gun safety advocates including former Arizona Congresswoman and gun violence survivor Gabby Giffords. ""The shooters from Oxford and MSU both showed concerning behavior beforehand."" Ohio divided:Ohio's gun laws have seen major changes in 20 years. What happened? Democrats' red flag bills passed along party lines. During the debate over the bills, GOP lawmakers argued the legislation would not have stopped the Feb. 13 shooting at Michigan State University's campus. The shooting prompted Democrats to reintroduce gun safety proposals that stalled in the previous GOP-led Legislature. Some suggested that they might have prevented the rampage at Michigan State. Bill sponsor state Sen. Mallory McMorrow said the red flag law will help prevent future tragedies involving guns. ""These laws, more than anything else, will buy time. Time to prevent the worst-case scenario. Time to save lives,"" she said. At least one law enforcement official ? Livingston County Sheriff Michael Murphy ? has vowed not to enforce the new red flag law. More than half of the state¡¯s counties have passed resolutions declaring themselves Second Amendment sanctuaries, which oppose laws they believe infringe on gun rights. But the Michigan State Police, which has jurisdiction throughout the state, could enforce the proposed red flag law, according to the state attorney general's office. A Michigan State Police spokesperson declined to comment on whether it would do so if a local law enforcement agency refused, calling it a hypothetical scenario. ¡°For those who are in law enforcement who refuse to enforce these important orders, let me say this loudly and clearly: I will make certain that I find someone with jurisdiction who will enforce these orders,¡± Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel said at the bill signing. More:Supreme Court leaves Illinois ban on 'assault rifles' in place for now Lawmakers across the nation in recent years have grappled with how to slow gun violence. According to the Gun Violence Archive, there have been at least 233 mass shootings so far in 2023 ? putting the United States on a record pace for mass shootings this year. Michigan became the 21st state to adopt a red flag law but questions on whether the state can successfully enforce the law remain. And research and analysis on the effectiveness on red flag laws are mixed. An?Associated Press analysis in September?found that in the 19 states with red flag laws, firearms were removed from people 15,049 times since 2020, fewer than 10 per 100,000 adult residents. Red flag laws in most states have not been in place long enough for there to be a comprehensive conclusion, said David Pucino,?deputy chief counsel at?Giffords?Law Center, a gun control organization led by?Giffords. And effectiveness depends on the implementation of red flag laws. There have been cases of law enforcement not using the law when the situation seemed to call for it. An investigation by the Indianapolis Star, part of the USA TODAY Network, found that police and prosecutors?failed to file in court more than 100 red flag cases that they should have. The Buffalo shooting in 2022 also raised red-flag questions as the 18-year-old suspect was referred for a mental health evaluation in the previous year after making a threat that was reviewed by state authorities.

Today, what to expect at Trump's arraignment. Plus, what new polling tells us about Biden, Trump and others for 2024, and hear how billions in COVID relief was stolen or wasted. ? Former President Donald Trump is expected at a federal courthouse in Miami today for his arraignment on charges that he kept classified documents at his Florida home after leaving the White House. For what to expect today, I spoke with USA TODAY Justice Department Correspondent Bart Jansen. Bart, welcome back to 5 Things. Bart Jansen: Thanks for having me. Taylor Wilson: So Bart, what's expected today leading up to the arraignment and what'll happen at the hearing itself? Bart Jansen: Yeah, Trump traveled from New Jersey to Florida on Monday. So he will be in the vicinity at his Doral Resort. He'll have to drive over to the courthouse. Google thinks that's about a half hour drive, but who knows with a big presidential style motorcade, what kind of traffic that might create. The hearing is scheduled for about 3:00 PM. It's called an initial appearance, but he has said that he will be pleading not guilty, so it becomes an arraignment in addition. So he makes at least an initial appearance to formally receive the indictment and is also expected to enter a plea. Taylor Wilson: What are the security concerns ahead of what will be a busy day in Miami today? Bart Jansen: Well, the courthouse itself is pretty secure. They have handled significant organized crime and drug cases. Somebody mentioned that Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega was brought to this courthouse at one point. So the facility itself is very secure. There were some concern about perhaps protestors either for or against Trump, or clashing with each other, could gather outside the courthouse. Trump was indicted in March in New York City on charges that he falsified business records there. He arrived at an arraignment and pleaded not guilty on those charges. And crowds gathered on both sides of those charges, but they were fairly sparse and they did not lead to violence. Of course, the concern stems from his urging supporters to come to Washington D.C. for the counting of electoral college votes on January 6th, 2021. Those sorts of larger crowds and potentially violent crowds aren't really a concern among security experts this time around because so many people have been charged from the January 6th case that protesters are fearful of being arrested, charged by federal authorities if they were to protest outside the court this time. So authorities will be keeping an eye on what kind of crowds arise, but there's no real concern about violence on Tuesday. Taylor Wilson: And Bart, you touched on this a bit, but what will we learn specifically about Trump's legal strategy going forward at this hearing? Bart Jansen: At the very least, we'll get introduced to lawyers. He dropped two lawyers who had been working for him on these federal investigations up to now on Friday, and assigned one of the lawyers who participated in his New York case, Todd Blanche, to represent him in this case, that he was going to hire additional lawyers as well. And so he'll have a new slate of people. In addition, the judge in this case, US District Judge Aileen Cannon, is familiar with the investigation because she's the one who ordered that a special master review the documents that the FBI seized at Mar-a-Lago to see if perhaps some of them should not be used by investigators. Trump had alleged that some of them might fall under attorney-client privilege or executive privilege. And so she assigned a special master. That order was overturned by the 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals saying that any challenge he wanted to make to evidence gathered in the case he'd have a chance to do that at trial. Well, here we go. The charges have been filed now. She has been assigned randomly to oversee that case. She may not be presiding at today's hearing. The Miami Herald has reported that a magistrate judge, Jonathan Goodman, will be presiding at this hearing. But this hearing itself promises to be fairly brief and routine, and then over and done. So he'd be processed, but he is expected to make a speech at Bedminster in New Jersey at 8:15 tonight. Taylor Wilson: Bart Jansen, thanks for your insight as always. Bart Jansen: Thanks for having me. ? Taylor Wilson: Both former President Donald Trump and current President Joe Biden face big liabilities in the latest USA TODAY/Suffolk poll. I spoke with USA TODAY Washington Bureau Chief Susan Page to learn more. Thanks for hopping on the podcast, Susan. Susan Page: Hey, it's great to be back with you. Taylor Wilson: So, you write that new polling shows us that both President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump have big liabilities. Susan, what are they? Susan Page: Well, for President Biden, it's his age. He's 80 years old. He's already the oldest president in our history. And we find that 37% of Democratic and Independent voters, so those are the voters he's going to want to appeal to, say his age makes [them] less likely to vote for him. So that's a significant hurdle for him as he seeks a second term. Trump has a parallel one in a way. It's not his age, it's his legal troubles. 34% of Republican and Independent voters, so that's his voter pool, say the fact that he's engaged in all these legal problems, including the indictment on federal charges, makes them less likely to support him. So that number is roughly the same for the two of them, although the hurdle that they have is a little different. Just one thing to add about Trump though, 11% say it makes them more likely to support him, so he gets a little bit of a rally around effect. Taylor Wilson: And sticking with Trump, how is he faring among Republicans at this point? Susan Page: Well, he's faring pretty well with Republicans. In the Republican contest, he's well ahead of everybody else. He's 25 points ahead of Ron DeSantis, the Florida governor, who is his most significant challenger. So the Republican contest really looks like it's his to lose. Taylor Wilson: And how are Biden and Trump faring head-to-head in this latest polling? Susan Page: If the election were held today, Biden edged out Trump by two percentage points. Now that's not very much, 34% to 32%. It's within our margin of error. The thing that's notable is about one in four Americans say they would vote for a third party candidate. That shows the level of dissatisfaction for a lot of voters with the choices they may well have next November. Taylor Wilson: And Susan, at this point, does Biden do better or worse in polling when compared to other Republicans? Susan Page: Well, Biden does better against DeSantis. He beats DeSantis by seven points, that lead is outside our margin of error. So at the moment, Trump is the stronger general election candidate despite all his legal troubles. Taylor Wilson:And what are the most important issues that voters are focused on, according to this polling? Susan Page: It depends on whether you're a Republican or a Democrat. Americans generally are concerned about inflation. But when you get past inflation, there's a big difference. Republicans care most after inflation about immigration. But if you talk to Democrats, there's a bunch of issues they care about. They care about gun control, and healthcare, education, and threats to democracy. All of those issues got the support and concern of 20% or more of Democrats. Taylor Wilson: USA TODAY Washington Bureau Chief Susan Page, always with some great polling info for us. Thanks so much, Susan. Susan Page: It's my pleasure. ? Taylor Wilson: Billions of dollars in COVID-19 relief aid was stolen or wasted. An Associated Press analysis has found that fraudsters potentially stole more than $280 billion in pandemic relief funding while another $123 billion was wasted or misspent. The combined loss represents about 10% of the more than $4 trillion the US government has so far dispersed in COVID aid. Much of the stolen money was taken through three large pandemic relief initiatives launched under the Trump administration and inherited by Biden. The programs were designed to help small businesses and unemployed workers survive the economic hardships of the pandemic. Investigators and outside experts say that the government conducted too little oversight, especially in the pandemic's early days, and put too few restrictions on applicants. Now, the government is trying to play catch up. So far, the US government has charged more than 2300 defendants with pandemic related fraud crimes, and it's conducting thousands of investigations. ? In vitro fertilization, or IVF, along with other fertility treatments, are expensive for most people who want children. But advocates say that LGBTQ+ couples face even higher financial barriers. That's because state laws and insurance policies can make it more difficult for them to receive fertility coverage. Those restrictions make an already costly process even more daunting for LGBTQ+ couples who tend to earn less, yet may also face the added expenses of needing sperm or egg donors, surrogates or gestational carriers. The community also faces a record amount of anti-LGBTQ+ bills introduced this year with some states proposing laws that could jeopardize access to IVF. For LGBTQ+ couples who want to foster or adopt instead of conceive, other roadblocks exist, with 13 states that allow state licensed child welfare agencies to turn away LGBTQ+ couples if it conflicts with their religious beliefs. There are efforts being made to expand fertility coverage for the LGBTQ+ community. President Joe Biden's 2024 fiscal year budget submission included proposed legislation that would expand access to fertility treatment and adoption reimbursement to single veterans, veterans in same-sex relationships and veterans who need donors, sperm, eggs, or embryos to build a family. The bill to end the debt ceiling crisis did not include that proposal, but the Biden administration continues to advocate for expanded access to assistive reproductive therapies. There are also proposals in a number of states. You can read more with a link in today's show notes. ? Is alcohol good for your health? Despite many harms linked to alcohol, research has shown that light to moderate drinking can have benefits that help protect the heart. And a new study may explain how that's possible. According to a report published this week in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, experts at Massachusetts General Hospital found that alcohol's linked to lowering the risk of heart disease may have something to do with reducing stress. But health experts say that doesn't mean more people should be drinking. Senior study author Dr. Ahmed Tawakol said the goal is still to find other approaches that could replicate or induce alcohol's protective heart effects without the adverse impacts of alcohol.

Parents of the children at the Covenant School, where three students and three school staff members were fatally shot in March, spoke of the horror they felt watching the Tennessee special session close with no significant gun legislation passed. ¡°Let me remind you. My daughter was hunted at her school,"" Mary Joyce said in an eerily silent room, as journalists watched her contain her tears at a news conference following the ending of the special session on Tuesday. ¡°She hid from a woman with a high-capacity rifle in her third-grade classroom,¡± Joyce added. ¡°She now understands what it feels like to be shot at. Since then, every single day she worries if it will be her last because it almost was.¡± The special session had initially been called by Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee in response to the Covenant School shooting. Despite the Republican governor's attempt to convince GOP lawmakers to pass a gun control legislation, no significant changes were made to the state's gun laws. Large contingents of Covenant School families attended the nearly week and a half of legislative hearings leading up to Tuesday's tumultuous proceedings. From chamber galleries to hallways and private offices, the families, wearing Covenant School red against the sea of state troopers and lawmakers ? made their presence known, at times quietly holding signs and at times chanting with the gathered crowds. ¡°Today, we will go home and we'll look at our children in the eyes ? many of whom were sheltered from gunfire that tragic day on March 27,¡± Joyce said. ¡°They will ask what our leaders have done over the past week and a half to protect them.

Ellis, who later told The Tennessean that he is a Second Amendment supporter, told Joyce that ¡°nobody listens to him¡± and his assertion that the solution to gun violence is arming more teachers. Joyce, whose 9-year-old daughter was in a classroom during the March mass shooting and lost three of her classmates, began crying.? ¡°I have been listening all summer!¡± she said. Still, many families found some solace in how one bill they pushed back against failed. They had a heavy presence in a tense House Criminal Justice Committee when it considered HB 7064, a bill sponsored by Rep. Chris Todd that would have allowed more people to carry firearms onto school campuses. The bill, which cleared the previous subcommittee hearings little opposition after demonstrators were removed from the room, failed after a tied vote. Despite the constant presence of the parents, the vast majority of bills backed by the parents' groups withered under the deal struck between the House and the Senate or never got introduced to begin with. David Teague, a father of two children at the school, said at the Tuesday news conference that he¡¯d ¡°hoped for more.¡± ¡°Today is a difficult day,¡± he said, through tears. ¡°A tremendous opportunity to make our children safer and create brighter tomorrows has been missed.

A little more than a year ago, a white gunman armed with a?semiautomatic rifle killed 10 people at Tops Friendly Markets in Buffalo, New York, including Whitfield's 86-year-old mother, Ruth Whitfield. In documents posted online, that shooter said he hoped the attack would help?preserve white power?and that he picked the grocery store because it was in a predominantly Black neighborhood. Whitfield's life was immediately changed. In the 15 months since, he has had to deal with an influx of media requests, addressed Congress about proposed gun control measures, met with survivors of other mass killings and began developing a memorial to the victims in Buffalo. He's been so busy, he said, he hasn't had time to grieve. But there's more work to be done. He said he hopes to connect with people in Jacksonville, the newest members of ""a club that nobody wants to belong to."" ""Life is going to be very different for them,"" he said. As hate crimes continue to increase in U.S. cities, those who lived through attacks against Black Americans in Buffalo and in Charleston, South Carolina say while life might never be the same, Jacksonville residents may be able to heal by coming together to create change and publicly honoring their loved ones.

""There were people just kind of milling around and in the street by the hundreds,"" he said. ""Hugging, crying, consoling one another, just talking, just looking for human connection."" Initially a ""media frenzy"" descended upon the area around Tops, but Anderson said days later reporters quickly began leaving as news broke of another mass shooting at a school in Uvalde, Texas. More than a year later, Whitfield said the Buffalo shooting is ""an afterthought in many cases,"" but he and the community are still working to recover. The pain of the shooting was ""heaped upon our pre-existing trauma, trauma of poverty, trauma of discrimination and racism,"" he said. Whitfield has had trouble sleeping and said it's been difficult to access mental health care. ""My life is just kind of a mess,"" he said. ""Trying to navigate the so-called systems that are in place to assist victims of violence has been very frustrating."" He advised those in Jacksonville to be proactive about asking for help. ""Find a way to channel your anger, your frustration, in a positive way,"" he said. ""Because oftentimes what happens is, the anger will consume you and you become just like the people who you're angry at."" It has been almost a decade since nine churchgoers were killed at the historic?Emanuel AME Church, also known as ¡°Mother Emanuel"" in Charleston, South Carolina, and that community is still healing. The members ? including Susie Jackson, an 87-year-old church trustee and choir member ? were at Bible study on June 17, 2015, when a white man joined them and later fatally shot nine of them. Five others survived. For Melvin Graham, whose younger sister, Cynthia Graham Hurd, was among those killed in Charleston, the healing started for him when soon after the shooting at Emanuel he saw an elderly white woman walking with a bouquet of flowers toward the church. Many had come to place flowers outside the church to honor the victims. ""That's when it sort of hit me that people care,"" he recalled, adding that the crowd didn¡¯t know at the time that he was Hurd's brother. ¡°Because at that time I was expecting people to run away for fear that, ¡®Oh, my gosh there's going to be retribution so I need to stay as far away as possible.¡¯ But instead, people rallied together.¡± In the years since, the church and community have held commemoration services. There are monuments throughout the city to honor them, including nine wooden benches with their names on them at a park near the church. A plaque at the front of the church lists their names. A memorial garden is named in honor of Jackson. The names of others are on buildings, including the Cynthia Graham Hurd/St. Andrews Library. The Graham family also started a book drive. Hurd, who was a librarian, was an avid reader. The foundation has given away thousands of books to local youth. Healing takes years, Graham said. And there are scars as reminders. And then that gut-punching pain when there's another racist attack. There have been 34 mass killings in which four or more victims are killed in 2023 according to a database?by USA TODAY, The Associated Press and Northeastern University. Meanwhile, hate crimes increased 11.6% in 2021, according to?a revised FBI report released earlier this year, and Black people were targeted more than any other racial group. ""In Jacksonville, if the Black and the white community come together to say, ¡®This is not who we are as a community. This is not who I am as a person. This is something I will not tolerate,¡¯ then the community can heal,"" Graham said. Last year, faith leaders and Biblical scholars from across the country gathered at the church to teach a Bible study on Mark 4:1-20, the lesson churchgoers were studying the night they were killed. Plans are underway to create the Emanuel Nine Memorial at the church. Church officials hope it will provide a safe space for reflections and help with healing. Unlike in Jacksonville, the shooters in Buffalo and Charleston survived to face stateandfederalcharges, including hate crime charges. Some victims' families have since had to face them in court. Earlier this year in Erie County Court, family members of several Buffalo shooting victims spoke about their loved ones and the ongoing mental and physical impacts of the shooting during an emotional sentencing hearing. Some angrily condemned the shooter. Others, like Kimberly Salter, the widow of security guard Aaron Salter, quoted from the Bible or said they were praying for him. Christopher Braden said he suffered from PTSD after being shot in the leg and described the slow, painful recovery process. ¡°Visions haunt me in my sleep every night,¡± he said. ¡°My scars and pain remind me of how strong I've become.¡± Just days after the attack in Charleston, Sharon Risher recalled watching on television from her home in Dallas, Texas as her sister, Nadine Collier, forgave the man who killed their mother, 70-year-old Ethel Lee Lance, at his bond hearing. ""I started screaming and hollering because I couldn't believe it,"" she said. It took her nearly two years, but Risher said she, too, was eventually able to forgive the shooter. She credits her faith with helping her change her mindset. ""When I said those words, I was finally released of that and it was like a big relief, a big sigh to say I finally have this off of me,"" she said. Still, Risher said the ongoing appeal process has been a constant reminder of the shooting, and she believes it may be a good thing the families in Jacksonville will be spared that experience. ""They won't have to go through a trial, they won't have to go through all of that, and appeals and everything,"" she said. ""So to have the killer not around, it sure will help."" Survivors and families of the victims in Buffalo have also filed a lawsuit against social media companies, the manufacturers of the shooter's weapons and body armor and the shooter's parents. More than a dozen plaintiffs filed civil cases against the FBI after the Charleston massacre, but it wasn't until 2021 that the?Justice Department announced?it had reached an $88 million settlement in those cases. Survivors of mass shootings have often demanded stronger gun control legislation and fought to keep the memories of their loved ones alive. Less than a month after the shooting in Buffalo, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul signed 10 public safety-related bills, including one prohibiting New Yorkers under age 21 from buying semiautomatic rifles, making the state among the first to enact a major gun control initiative following a wave of deadly mass shootings. Supreme Court gun rulingNY case divides the nation One day later, Whitfield challenged Congress to stop the ¡°cancer of white supremacy¡± and the growing epidemic of gun violence in an emotional hearing on Capitol Hill. Congress later passed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the largest gun safety package in three decades. The measure aims to keep dangerous people from getting firearms and to invest in school safety and mental health resources. Whitfield said the goal of his advocacy work is to make ""sure that people are not allowed to forget what happened here."" He said the situation in Jacksonville is ""particularly difficult"" because of local leaders such as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who was booed while speaking at a vigil for the victims and has faced criticism for his policies, including?the approval?of new African American history standards. Whitfield said he hopes the incident will lead those survivors to call for change, too. In Charleston, many initially focused on removing the Confederate flag from the front of the state Capitol. For many Black citizens, the flag stood as a symbol of slavery and oppression. The shooter posed for photographs in front of the Confederate flag. That happened. Then efforts turned to legislative action. But a bill aimed at curbing access to guns through expanded background checks failed. There was also a push for more economic support, including doing more business with minority vendors and companies. Another bill that would enhance penalties for a hate crime passed the South Carolina House, but hasn¡¯t moved in the Senate. Marlon Kimpson, a former South Carolina senator who represented the district where the Charleston shooting happened, believed there was more resistance in part because it mentions LGBTQ communities. ¡°Those were efforts that grew out of the tragedy,¡¯¡¯ Kimpson, a Democrat, said. ¡°But even though some of those failed, there is a continuing social engagement and level of activism to push other agenda initiatives.¡¯¡¯ Still, he said, more work needs to be done to heal. ¡°It¡¯s an ongoing process. Even as we look at Charleston today there¡¯s still not economic parity,¡¯¡¯ he said. Risher has become a volunteer with Moms Demand Action, part of Everytown for Gun Safety. She participates in speaking engagements, meets with other survivors and has written a book about her experiences, all of which she said has helped her process the trauma of the shooting. ""Some people probably won't go that route, but that was the route that saved me,"" she said. Despite these efforts, new mass shootings continue to make headlines. Risher said hearing about shootings like the one in Jacksonville takes ""you right back to the day that all of that was going on for you."" ""Your life is never gonna be the same,"" she said. ""That's just the bottom line."" Contributing: Grace Hauck and Jeanine Santucci, USA TODAY; The Associated Press",USA

Texas was also the site of a mass shooting last weekend when a gunman killed five people in Cleveland, Texas. Gun control advocates celebrated last June after Biden signed a bipartisan gun control bill in the wake of a shooting at an elementary school that left 21 people ? 19 students and two teachers dead ? in Uvalde, Texas. But as the country continues to experience a slew of mass shootings, Biden has pleaded with Congress to do more, including banning assault weapons. After a mass shooting in Nashville, Tennessee that left three children and three adults dead in March, Biden said he has exhausted all of his executive authority. Congressional Democrats have followed Biden¡¯s lead and have also called for stronger gun control laws, but there appears to be little appetite among congressional Republicans for any additional laws.

Gavin Newsom proposes 28th Amendment to the Constitution to combat gun violence,"California Gov. Gavin Newsom proposed Thursday adding a 28th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which he said will address the country's gun violence crisis. The amendment would raise the minimum age to purchase a gun from 18 to 21, mandate universal background checks, institute a reasonable waiting period for all gun purchases and bar civilians from purchasing assault weapons, according to a statement from the governor's office. ""This will guarantee states as well the ability to enact common sense gun safety laws, while leaving the Second Amendment intact, and respecting America's gun owning tradition,"" Newsom said in a video statement. ""The 28th Amendment locks in the common sense constitutional protections that Democrats, Republicans, Independents and gun owners overwhelmingly support and ensures NRA-owned politicians can never strip those protections away."" Six in 10 Americans, including four in 10 gun owners, said controlling gun violence is more important than protecting gun rights ? the highest percentage in a decade ? according to a national poll released last month. Newsom told Politico and NBC the move was inspired in part by the rollback of gun safety measures by the courts. The move comes amid speculation that Newsom may run for president, which grew after he won a second term as governor, which ends in 2026, and dropped $10 million on a new political action committee. Newsom has denied planning to run in 2024 or 2028, saying he supports President Joe Biden and wants Vice President Kamala Harris, a fellow Californian, to be president. Poll:Is stopping gun violence more important than gun rights? Most Americans say yes The move has drawn opposition from gun-ownership groups. A spokesperson for The National Rifle Association said in a statement to USA TODAY that the majority of Americans reject Newsom's ""California-style gun control.¡±?? ¡°Newsom¡¯s latest publicly stunt once again shows that his unhinged contempt for the right to self-defense has no bounds,"" the statement said. ""California is a beacon for violence because of Newsom¡¯s embrace of policies that champion the criminal and penalize the law-abiding."" Erich Pratt, senior vice president of Gun Owners of America said ""Newsom's proposals will fail miserably to control crime."" ""It's a foreign concept to wealthy anti-gun political elites like Mr. Newsom that the common people have a right to possess arms for self-defense and repelling government tyranny, so it's no surprise to us that he hopes to butcher that right with a new Constitutional amendment,"" he said in a statement to USA TODAY. Adding a constitutional amendment requires either?a two-thirds majority vote by both houses of Congress or a constitutional convention convened by two-thirds of State legislatures, according to Thomas Donnelly, chief content officer at the National Constitution Center. None of the 27 amendments to the Constitution have been proposed by a convention and the last time the Constitution was amended was in 1992, he said. Three-fourths of the states must ratify the proposed amendment in order for it to become part of the Constitution, Donnelly said. Donnelly declined to speculate on the likelihood of Newsom's success. But he said the process is ""meant to be difficult."" ""The founders really wanted to limit new amendments to those that can actually secure the broad support of the American people, so for them, they would have said 'an idea that would transcend faction,'"" he said. ""Today, we would say it's often something that's going to transcend partisan politics."" Mass killing database:Revealing trends, details and anguish of every US event since 2006 Given the impact of the Supreme Court's landmark ruling on gun control last year, ""something like a Constitutional amendment may seem absolutely necessary,"" according to Michael Waldman, president and CEO of the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU Law. Waldman, author of ""The Supermajority: How the Supreme Court Divided the Country,"" called Newsom's approach, which leaves the Second Amendment intact but allows for ""common sense gun laws"" that may be palatable to some gun rights supporters, creative and interesting. He said Newsom's amendment ""is not likely to happen, but it's important to think about it."" ""Constitutional amendments seem completely impossible to do until suddenly they seem doable, and that's how it's worked all throughout our history,"" Waldman said. ""If the Court's doctrine is so misguided and the carnage on the streets is so undeniable, you might get a surprising outcome."" Newsom acknowledged how challenging the process would be, saying ""this fight won't be easy, and it certainly won't be fast."" California State Sen. Aisha Wahab and Assemblymember Reggie Jones-Sawyer will introduce a joint resolution to make California the first state to call for a convention, also called an Article V Convention or amendatory convention, according to the governor's statement. Newsom will then work with ""grassroots supporters, elected and civic leaders, and broad and diverse coalitions across the nation"" to get similar resolutions passed in the 33 other states required to convene the convention, the statement said. ""California will be the first but that's just the beginning,"" Newsom said in a statement. Contributing: The Associated Press; Grace Hauck, USA TODAY",USA
https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/06/18/poll-abortion-support-dobbs-overturned-roe-v-wade/70320647007/,2023-06-18,Exclusive: Support for legal abortion rises a year after Roe v. Wade overturned-Poll,"In what was surely a case of unintended consequences, the landmark Supreme Court decision one year ago overturning Roe v. Wade is putting abortion opponents increasingly at odds with public opinion and creating political perils for candidates on their side. In a new USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll, one in four Americans say state efforts that have followed to impose strict limits on abortion access have made them more supportive of abortion rights. The Dobbs decision, which removed access to abortion as a constitutionally protected right, elated the anti-abortion movement but its aftermath is helping boost support for legal abortion to historic highs and reshaping the debate over what has long been the deepest political wedge issue in the nation. ""I don't think it should have been overturned,"" Tanya Goodpasture, 53, of Independence, Missouri, said in a follow-up interview after being polled. A Republican who voted for Donald Trump in 2020, she expressed concern about abortion, especially after a fetus' heartbeat could be detected. But she added: ""We're here to make our own choices and deal with the repercussions."" By almost 4-1, 23%-6%, those whose views on abortion have changed in the past year said they have become more supportive of legal abortion, not less supportive. That includes more women than men, more Democrats than Republicans, and more younger voters than seniors. The shift was pronounced among Black respondents. Almost a third, 32%, said they had become more supportive of abortion access in the past year. And independent women, one of the most critical swing groups in elections, by 28%-5% said they had become more supportive of abortion rights. The nationwide poll of 1,000 registered voters, taken by landline and cellphone June 5-9, has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points. By almost 2-1, 58%-30%, those surveyed opposed the decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. Americans ranked other issues as more important in determining their vote in next year's election. Inflation was first, followed by immigration, threats to democracy and gun control. Abortion tied with education as fifth. That said, more than three in four said abortion would be an important issue for them; 20% said it would be the single most important issue. That includes those on both sides. ""The first thing that the federal government should do is protect life,"" said Sarah Foust, 37, a preschool teacher from Myrtle Beach, S.C. A Republican, she supports banning all abortions. ""That's with the military and that's also for the most vulnerable, which are children in the womb, who are kids."" But Jamie Nassehi, 63, a builder and a Democrat from Silver Spring, Maryland, said access to abortion has become a more important issue to him in the wake of the Supreme Court ruling. ""States are criminalizing something that was a precedent for 50 years,"" he said. In a reference to the religious right and the more conservative majority on the high court, he said, ""If they keep going, this country will be unrecognizable because they force their views on everybody and they're a minority, really."" Americans overwhelmingly oppose the next goal of many anti-abortion activists, to enact a federal law banning abortion nationwide. By 80%-14%, those surveyed opposed that idea, including 65% of Republicans and 83% of independents. By 53%-39%, they supported a federal law ensuring access to abortion. ""When 80% of Democrats and 53% of independents want Congress to pass a law ensuring nationwide access to abortion, you get the picture here,"" said David Paleologos, director of Suffolk University's Political Research Center. ""Among women in the all-important independent-voter demographic, 63% support a national law. Even 23% of Republican men and women support it."" Since the Dobbs decision in June 2022, abortion has become unavailable in 14 states, and courts have blocked enforcement of bans in several others, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which tracks reproductive issues. Some new bans were passed by state legislatures and pre-Roe laws have gone back into effect in other states. Georgia is now enforcing a ban at six weeks of pregnancy, Nebraska at 12 weeks, and Arizona and Florida at 15 weeks. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has signed a ban at six weeks, contingent on a pending state court decision. North Carolina has passed a 12-week ban, set to go into effect July 1. The USA TODAY/Suffolk findings were consistent were other survey research. The Gallup Poll reports that support for legal abortion rose in reaction to the Dobbs decision and has remained at record highs. Last month, 69% said abortion should generally be legal in the first three months of pregnancy, the highest level since Gallup first asked the question in 1975. Views of abortion rights are complicated. In the poll, 26% said abortion should be legal in all cases; 8% said it should be illegal in all cases. Most fell somewhere in-between, supporting not only access to abortion but also some restrictions on it. In all, a 53% majority said abortion should be legal in most or all cases; 28% said it should be illegal in most or all cases. Where should that line be drawn? Eighteen percent support a restriction at six weeks of pregnancy; 17% at 15 weeks and 9% at 22 weeks. Eleven percent say abortion should be restricted at the point the fetus is viable; 26% oppose all limits. Rebecca Romano, 35, who works in a retirement community in Mesa, Arizona, said support for legal abortion would be a ""very, very big factor"" for her vote. An independent, she voted for a third-party candidate in the last presidential election. ""I think for the health and wellness of women, it's a huge issue,"" she said. ""I feel like we literally just went backwards."" She would like the Supreme Court to change course and recognize access to abortion as a constitutional right. ""I feel like Roe vs. Wade needs to be turned over again,"" she said. What is the Dobbs decision?:Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade, eliminating constitutional right to abortion",USA
https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/08/12/biden-campaign-trump-indictments/70512593007/,2023-08-12,How Biden plans to run against Trump ? but not the GOP frontrunner's indictments,"WASHINGTON ? President Joe Biden was on the way to a seafood spot near the beach for a vacation dinner, when his predecessor, Donald Trump, was indicted for conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Trump decried ""another fake indictment"" on his social media platform Truth Social. Biden ended his night in Rehoboth Beach, Del. with first lady Jill Biden watching the Hollywood hit film ""Oppenheimer"" before an evening stroll along the water. The striking split screen emphasizes the way the White House and Biden campaign are approaching a potentially unprecedented scenario: running against a former Republican president whose been indicted three times and who is accusing Biden of ordering the prosecution. The plan for now: Stay as far away as possible from Trump's legal fights ? even as multiple trials are on course to collide with the 2024 election. ""There's a thing in our business called the responsive court,"" said Celinda Lake, one of Biden's 2020 campaign pollsters, ""where sometimes it's stronger when people draw their own conclusions than when you say the conclusion for them. And I think this is that case."" Rather than being prodded into addressing Trump's accusations of election interference, the Biden campaign is keeping its head down, focused on behind-the-scenes activities like fundraising, building up its data machine and installing staff for the campaign headquarters in Biden's home of Wilmington, Delaware. ""The Biden campaign is clearly adopting a slow-and-steady-wins-the-race attitude,"" said Simon Rosenberg, a veteran Democratic strategist. ""They have a good story to tell, they're going to go tell it, and they're watching the other side light themselves on fire."" As Biden, the likely Democratic nominee, begins to make his case for four more years, the candidate and campaign aren't saying anything about Trump's legal troubles or the Jan. 6, 2021 assault on the Capitol at the center of Trump's third indictment. That Biden isn't engaging on Trump's three indictments ? with a fourth perhaps coming this month in Georgia ? is not surprising. Biden weighing in on any of the cases would only fuel claims by Republicans that he and his appointed attorney general, Merrick Garland, are trying to stop Trump, the well-established Republican primary frontrunner, from winning the 2024 presidential election, legal experts say. Biden promised an independent Justice Department after Trump blurred those lines during his time in the White House ? and it's a commitment that Biden's campaign says the president takes seriously and intends to keep. The White House on Friday declined to comment on the Department of Justice's appointment of a special counsel in Hunter Biden's case. Yet the Biden campaign faces a tightrope not to engage in Trump's legal matters during the campaign while also making 2024 a ""choice election"" that includes a contest over character and a robust defense of American democracy during a possible rematch against Trump. Kristy Parker, a former federal prosecutor who was a deputy chief in the criminal section DOJ's civil rights division, said Biden should avoid of making comments about anything that has a connection to evidence that might be presented in court or the defenses that Trump and his attorneys are raising. ""It's important for those things to play out in the court proceedings and for the President of the United States to not be doing anything that could conceivably impact a trial,"" said Parker, who is counsel for the group Protect Democracy. ""He¡¯s just going to want to, and should, steer pretty far clear of anything that relates to the ongoing legal proceedings.¡± Biden announced his reelection bid in April with a video that opened with imagery of flag-waving, Trump supporters at the Jan. 6 Capitol attack. He argued ""the battle for the soul of the nation"" isn't over. It was a not-so-subtle nod at the divisive politics of Trump. The temptation to fire back at Trump over his legal woes could mount further as House Republicans accelerate investigations into the foreign business dealings of Biden's son Hunter Biden with threats to open an impeachment inquiry into the president. ""Why hesitate to mention the elephant in the room that's in handcuffs?"" said David Cohen, a political science professor at the University of Akron, referring to Trump's legal troubles. ""It's just too big a story to ignore. And it's too big a reminder to not use in a campaign."" Cohen added: ""Because regardless what Joe Biden says or does, or doesn't say or doesn't do, Republicans are still going to claim that all of these charges against Donald Trump are politically motivated."" Parker said Biden can talk about January 6 and defend democracy without crossing the line by talking in broad terms about America's institutions and how they are supposed to behave and even Trump¡¯s suggestion that he could seek revenge on Special Counsel Jack Smith and the DOJ attorneys who are prosecuting him. ""You can certainly say, we should have peaceful transfers of power, we should accept the results of elections, without talking in specifics,"" Parker said. ""Like, we shouldn't have insurrections, what happened on January 6 is a thing we should never see again. I think you can talk in those general terms without talking about the charges in the case or the ongoing prosecutions.¡± With the 2024 general election still 15 months away, Biden and his campaign are refusing to veer off course by commenting on the drama surrounding Trump's court proceedings, which is being covered extensively in the media and voters already know about. Instead, the Biden campaign is doubling down on an economic case against Trump, arguing that Biden has delivered on Trump's unfulfilled promise to reinvigorate domestic manufacturing. Biden campaign spokesman Kevin Munoz pointed to Trump¡¯s policy agenda, not his legal troubles, in a statement, arguing that ¡°Like every Republican running for president, Donald Trump is running on an extreme, unpopular agenda.¡± ¡°As we saw in the midterms and continue to see in down-ballot races in 2023, Americans reject the agenda Donald Trump embodies. President Biden will continue to campaign for our freedoms, for our middle class, and for our democracy ? these are the issues Americans outside the beltway continue to head to the ballot box on.""? Since Trump's third indictment came down last week, Biden has pushed his ""Bidenomics"" economic message during a trip to the Southwest with stops in Arizona and New Mexico and visited Utah for the one-year anniversary of the PACT Act, which expanded benefits for veterans. The campaign this week rolled out endorsements from a coalition of gun control advocacy groups. Biden has also largely ignored reporters, allowing him to avoid questions about Trump's latest indictment and his son Hunter business ventures, and his press secretary has taken questions at just one formal engagement with the press. ""I never talked business with anybody,"" a visibly upset Biden told a reporter Wednesday when asked about testimony from one of Hunter Biden's associates in the Oversight House Committee's investigation. Most of Biden's official White House travel has been aimed at turning around perceptions about the economy, with Biden stressing his administration's efforts to revitalize U.S. manufacturing, as he works to get credit for inflation that has cooled down, a booming jobs market and historically low unemployment. Yet there remains a major disconnect with most Americans. A Reuters/Ipsos poll on Thursday showed 54% of Americans disapprove of Biden's handling of the economy, while only 40% approve. Rosenberg said the economy is likely to be the No. 1 issue in the election as it has been in most previous presidential races. ""Biden's not where he needs to be there. He's got work to do there,"" he said. ""But it's doable work. Because the economy is actually better today. We are better off today as a country."" Democrats also plan to put abortion at the center of the general election that will take place more than two years after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and ruled against a constitutional right to abortion. The issue helped Democrats overcome headwinds during last year's midterm elections and exceed expectations. Biden's campaign says that Vice President Kamala Harris will continue to take the lead in speaking out in favor of reproductive rights at events around the country. Biden seized on Tuesday's defeat of an amendment in Ohio that would have made it harder for voters to protect abortion access via referendum, declaring ""tonight democracy won."" Outside of aggressive fundraising, Biden has ran a low-key campaign since announcing his reelection bid in April, holding no major political events ahead of next year's Democratic presidential primary contests. The Biden campaign spent just $1.1 million ? a paltry sum by campaign standards ? during the second quarter that ended June 30, saving resources to build a massive campaign war chest of $77 million while Republican candidates spend heavily to introduce themselves to voters and attack each other during their primary. The president is expected to conduct a more visible campaign in the fall ? but Democrats say voters should not brace for Biden to bring up the legal troubles of his top political rival. Lake, who conducts polling for the Democratic National Committee, said Trump's indictments paint a stronger picture when discussed in the media than by the campaign.

She called for?schools to have one entrance and to use the metal detectors there.? ""It's okay if there are metal detectors. There are those guests coming in out, the kids see them in an airport, they see them wherever they go. Why don't we do that to protect those kids?"" Haley said.

https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2023/05/03/texas-shooting-shows-need-prayer-action-gun-violence/70173992007/,2023-05-03,Gun violence from Texas to Nashville should call Americans to prayer ? and to action,"On Friday night near Cleveland, Texas, police say, a man with an AR-15 shot to death five of his neighbors, including a 9-year-old boy. On Monday afternoon, police found seven people dead, including two missing teenage girls, at a home in the small town of Henryetta, Oklahoma. As a nation, we are only weeks removed from the shooting at a church school in Nashville, Tennessee and the shooting at a bank in Louisville, Kentucky. And those are only crimes that have captured national attention. In cities across the country, citizens live in fear of their lives, besieged by violence on the streets and in homes, workplaces, schools and churches. The Covenant School shooting in Nashville was personal for our family. We lived in Nashville for 10 years and love that growing metro with a small-town heart. A dear friend¡¯s children attend Covenant School. A colleague at Texas Baptist College, affiliated with the seminary where I work, lost a nephew. And my wife was part of a prayer group of moms that included the Covenant pastor¡¯s wife. It¡¯s hard to comprehend the depravity that motivates someone to gun down people in cold blood. For every shooting, there are survivors whose lives will never be the same. Just read this haunting profile of the victims of the Sulphur Springs, Texas shooting from five years ago. I survived a mass shootingand found Americans aren't all that divided on gun safety I saw the Louisville shooting happen.What we're doing now on gun violence isn't working. Unfortunately, after every mass shooting there is a predictable cycle where Democrats and Republicans blame each other, scoring quick rhetorical points that offer political catharsis but few solutions. The exception was the massacre in Uvalde, Texas, which resulted in bipartisan federal legislation that included funding for mental health, funding for state red flag laws, tightening laws on gun trafficking, funding for existing school safety programs and a few other laws tightening gun purchases. But clearly, we have more work to do to reduce incidents of violence and to make our communities safe. I¡¯m a conservative, but I recognize that this multi-layered, complicated epidemic will require both political parties to work together. We're a Democrat and a Republican:Here's how both parties can start on gun reform ? together Gov. Andy Beshear must show leadership:Kentucky governor lost his friend in a mass shooting but has said little about guns. Why? Republicans should ask themselves what measures they could offer that might create more friction between guns and the people intent on committing acts of murder. A few Republicans in the Senate supported red flag legislation last year and 19 states, including conservative states such as Indiana and Florida, have red flag laws. Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee has urged his fellow Republicans in the state legislature to follow suit. Democrats might acknowledge what is possible. The United States is not Australia. We have a Second Amendment that isn¡¯t going anywhere. So are they willing to vote for protective measures such as Tennessee Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn¡¯s school safety bill, which would provide federal grants to help public and private schools be protected by police officers? And might the media be part of the solution? Are journalists willing to call attention to the daily violence in communities around the country, often in cities that boast of stringent gun laws but where other causes of crime are sometimes ignored by left-wing prosecutors? Taking this issue seriously will require Republicans and Democrats, conservatives and liberals, gun owners and gun control advocates to work together. We¡¯ll need to ask ourselves what is effective and what is doable in America. I'm a gun owner.I know I'm a sitting duck until commonsense gun laws are on the books. Common sense:Gun violence is the No. 1 killer of children. Here are commonsense steps to address it. Even as we encourage our leaders to shape public policy, we also need to look deeper than our state capitols and Washington, D.C. and acknowledge a deep spiritual sickness. Laws can do much to curb violence, but they can¡¯t do everything. Christians rightly rage at death. Jesus, at Lazarus¡¯ tomb, wept and was angry. We find our hope in the resurrection of Christ, who defeated the power of death. Yet, our hope doesn¡¯t keep us from working to prevent future acts of violence. We both pray and we act. America is in need of serious moral and spiritual renewal. Our founders understood that our unique experiment in freedom will hold up only if there is a corresponding spiritual foundation. As John Adams said, ¡°Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.¡± If we really want to see mass shootings be less common, it's time for us to stop pointing fingers and to start acting and praying.

Now I train women to use guns to protect themselves.,"As a survivor of childhood sexual abuse and later rape during my college years, my life¡¯s journey is marked by determination to be more than what happened to me, constant dedication to the work of healing, being willing to push through the scars that abuse left, and committing myself to whatever it takes to never be unable to protect myself in life-threatening situations. As a young woman, trying to put back together the shattered pieces of my life, I promised myself I would not allow my trauma to define me nor would I ever be a victim again. That led me on a journey to learn everything I could about self-protection. Like many Americans, I did not grow up in homes where firearms were present.?As a result, I relate to those individuals, frequently women, who are intimidated by firearms. I was first exposed to handguns for personal protection when I was gifted a handgun and a concealed-carry class for my 30th?birthday. I was empowered by this experience and soon began spending more and more time at the range and learning to be proficient in self-defense. In 2020, a year marked by social unrest and violent upheavals in the aftermath of George Floyd's death,?friends started coming to me for guidance on how to protect themselves and their families. I spent nearly every free moment I had for the next five months at the range, sharing what I had learned with the dozens of women wanting help. Word of my informal training spread quickly by word of mouth, and one day a woman handed me $80 at the end of our time and said, ¡°You should charge for this training.¡± Two days later I had a website and a logo, and I have never looked back. I have dedicated my life to learning from the best of the best in the industry and have now personally invested thousands of hours into teaching first-time gun owners in Tennessee, primarily women, on how to be their own first responders. On a more personal note, as a single mother, I recognize that I am solely responsible for my daughters' safety. I never want them to be vulnerable the way I was, and like every mother I know, there is nothing I wouldn't do to protect them. The memory of the Covenant School tragedy on March 27 remains etched in the collective consciousness of every Tennessean. During those harrowing moments, I prayed for the presence of an armed and resolute individual who could shield students and staff and make the killing stop. In these active shooter incidents, the longer it takes for a good guy with a gun to get on scene, the more people are killed.?At the Christian school in the Nashville neighborhood of Green Hills, the shooter left three children and three adults dead. A pediatrician's view:I remember every gunshot victim I've treated. Our gun laws must change. The National Firearms Survey by Centiment of 54,000 U.S. adults, conducted in 2021 and updated in 2022, is the largest and most comprehensive look at American gun ownership to date. The survey indicates that firearms are employed in self-defense approximately 1.7 million times annually. Guns save lives. So why do we send our children to schools in gun-free zones where the adults who are supposed to protect them are defenseless but when time really matters, they call for someone with a gun to come help and wait while innocents continue to be killed. Tennessee has deemed schools gun-free zones. Instead, they ought to be fortresses of safety for our most precious ? our children ? and willing teachers should be armed and trained. In this past week¡¯s special session of the state legislature, there was proposed legislation for extreme risk protection orders, more commonly known as red flag laws. They allow judges, via a petition from loved ones or law enforcement, to restrict individuals from acquiring or possessing a firearm when these warning signs constitute a threat to themselves or others. A father's view:Children are terrified of school shootings, gun violence. Tennessee lawmakers should listen. According to?the federal government, approximately 8% of women and 4% of men will experience post-traumatic stress disorder at some point in their lifetimes. Red flag laws have the potential to leave millions of Americans ? people like myself, veterans, mothers dealing with postpartum depression and women escaping an abusive relationship ? defenseless. Such orders infringe upon the rights of citizens who have not been convicted or even charged with a crime. In the wake of the Covenant School tragedy, proponents of gun control have resorted to intimidation and mob mentality tactics, pressuring lawmakers to erode the ability of law-abiding Tennesseans to protect themselves. History has shown that any failure of these newly enacted gun control measures to enhance public safety prompts subsequent demands for more stringent regulations. If we continue down this path, we will be left? defenseless. I urge all Tennesseans to steadfastly champion our fundamental right to protect ourselves, our homes and our families.
